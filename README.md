# nogisubs
## Contents
Here there are many subtitles of some of Nogizaka46 tv shows. Which ones?
* *Nogizakatte, doko?*
* *Nogizaka Under Construction*
* *Nogibingo*

The collection is not complete.
It's just a way I have to order what I've gathered so far.
You can find more subs online; you can also find many episodes already subbed.

## Sources
I haven't made the subs myself. Tere are communities and individuals who take care of it. A few names:
[IkomaSubs](https://ikomasubs.wordpress.com/),
[Qelopin](http://qelopin.blogspot.com/),
AIDOL,
Ikudon
and many more. The credits for the hard work go to them.
