1
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:29,600
<font face="Calibri" size="51">When I saw people wearing black, I got the feeling that we were all heading towards the same place</font>

2
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,770
<font face="Calibri" size="51">It was a strange yet familiar feeling</font>

3
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:36,580
<font face="Calibri" size="51">It's like being a kid inside a bus while heading to the public pool,</font>

4
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:40,210
<font face="Calibri" size="51">feeling that everyone around me is also going to the pool.</font>

5
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:42,650
<font face="Calibri" size="51">That sensation</font>

6
00:00:46,160 --> 00:01:00,540
<font face="@HGGyoshotai" size="90"><i>Ari no Koto</i></font>

7
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:03,140
<font face="Calibri" size="51">I was part of a 5-member idol group</font>

8
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:06,140
<font face="Calibri" size="51">The group's name was Udagawa White Bears</font>

9
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:09,740
<font face="Calibri" size="51">It was often teased for sounding like a boys baseball team</font>

10
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:12,180
<font face="Calibri" size="51">It's been a year since disbandment</font>

11
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,820
<font face="Calibri" size="51">We weren't really that popular anyways</font>

12
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:17,450
<font face="Calibri" size="51">Our center's withdrawal decided our fate</font>

13
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,390
<font face="Calibri" size="51">Us that were left behind tried our best to continue for a while,</font>

14
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:26,690
<font face="Calibri" size="51">but the final live went in shambles and ended miserably.</font>

15
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:27,690
<font face="Calibri" size="51">Ari!</font>

16
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:32,970
<font face="Calibri" size="51">It's been awhile! Doing well?</font>

17
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:35,570
<font face="Calibri" size="51">Yeah! Looks like Sumi took the same train</font>

18
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:37,940
<font face="Calibri" size="51">I made a mistake and just rushed in the train</font>

19
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:40,370
<font face="Calibri" size="51">Me too</font>

20
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,680
<font face="Calibri" size="51">Somehow you look like an adult now</font>

21
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:44,600
<font face="Calibri" size="51">Really?</font>

22
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,050
<font face="Calibri" size="51">I haven't changed at all though</font>

23
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:48,730
<font face="Calibri" size="51">Maybe it's because you're wearing black</font>

24
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:49,600
<font face="Calibri" size="51">So are you!</font>

25
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,600
<font face="Calibri" size="51">That's true</font>

26
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:55,550
<font face="Calibri" size="51">It's been awhile!</font>

27
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:56,350
<font face="Calibri" size="51">It's been awhile</font>

28
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:57,690
<font face="Calibri" size="51">Sorry for being late</font>

29
00:01:57,690 --> 00:01:59,320
<font face="Calibri" size="51">It's fine. It's nice to see you both of you</font>

30
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,120
<font face="Calibri" size="51">Have you been well?</font>

31
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,620
<font face="Calibri" size="51">Do you have a safety pin?</font>

32
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:04,520
<font face="Calibri" size="51">Her blazer got a rip on the back</font>

33
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:08,370
<font face="Calibri" size="51">Unbelievable right? It's been so long and she tears her clothes</font>

34
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:10,170
<font face="Calibri" size="51">How did this even happen?</font>

35
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:13,070
<font face="Calibri" size="51">I don't know, I just rode the train as usual though</font>

36
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:14,780
<font face="Calibri" size="51">I brought one with me</font>

37
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:16,780
<font face="Calibri" size="51">Really? Nice!</font>

38
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,180
<font face="Calibri" size="51">So Samu lived in this kind of area</font>

39
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:24,250
<font face="Calibri" size="51">But it's way off where you'd expect Samu to live right?</font>

40
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:26,250
<font face="Calibri" size="51">That's true</font>

41
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,890
<font face="Calibri" size="51">Thanks</font>

42
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:29,860
<font face="Calibri" size="51">Let's ride a taxi?</font>

43
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:32,190
<font face="Calibri" size="51">I say that but there seems to be none</font>

44
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,600
<font face="Calibri" size="51">It looks like we can walk it though
-Really?</font>

45
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:37,400
<font face="Calibri" size="51">I searched it up awhile ago and it's around 15 minutes away</font>

46
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,400
<font face="Calibri" size="51">As expected of you</font>

47
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:41,070
<font face="Calibri" size="51">It seems to be that way</font>

48
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:43,520
<font face="Calibri" size="51">Then let's head that way
-Let's go</font>

49
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,740
<font face="Calibri" size="51">It's just pitch black</font>

50
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:47,120
<font face="Calibri" size="51">There's nothing in sight at all</font>

51
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:49,010
<font face="Calibri" size="51">It's already late after all</font>

52
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,150
<font face="Calibri" size="51">The names we go may be weird to others</font>

53
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:55,580
<font face="Calibri" size="51">But they come from parts of our names</font>

54
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:57,580
<font face="Calibri" size="51">My name is Arimoto, hence Ari</font>

55
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,690
<font face="Calibri" size="51">Sumi is Hasumi</font>

56
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:01,090
<font face="Calibri" size="51">Kimu is Kimura</font>

57
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:02,760
<font face="Calibri" size="51">Momo is Momoko</font>

58
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,100
<font face="Calibri" size="51">But Samu is the only exception</font>

59
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:08,730
<font face="Calibri" size="51">Even though the name Ito Chika does not contain "samu" anywhere</font>

60
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,730
<font face="Calibri" size="51">but for some reason, we called her Samu</font>

61
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,140
<font face="Calibri" size="51">That Samu, 2 days ago</font>

62
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:14,700
<font face="Calibri" size="51">on the way home from buying something</font>

63
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,600
<font face="Calibri" size="51">got hit by a truck and passed away</font>

64
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:23,510
<font face="Calibri" size="51">We were lucky we found a taxi.</font>

65
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:27,350
<font face="Calibri" size="51">Who would've known that we were going the wrong way</font>

66
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,680
<font face="Calibri" size="51">Seriously</font>

67
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,950
<font face="Calibri" size="51">What happens again in funerals?</font>

68
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,060
<font face="Calibri" size="51">It's a wake, not a funeral</font>

69
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:35,720
<font face="Calibri" size="51">I don't know either way</font>

70
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:39,500
<font face="Calibri" size="51">First light an incense, and then give the family your condolences</font>

71
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,160
<font face="Calibri" size="51">What exactly do I have to say?</font>

72
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:47,840
<font face="Calibri" size="51">We learned of her death only last night</font>

73
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,320
<font face="Calibri" size="51">So everyone looked for clothes in a rush,</font>

74
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:53,370
<font face="Calibri" size="51">not having any mourning dresses at hand, it was really rude</font>

75
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,350
<font face="Calibri" size="51">Isn't the cabinet smell bad?</font>

76
00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:00,950
<font face="Calibri" size="51">Really?</font>

77
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:02,700
<font face="Calibri" size="51">I just borrowed this from my mom</font>

78
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:04,550
<font face="Calibri" size="51">There's a big shoulder pad inside</font>

79
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:06,190
<font face="Calibri" size="51">Are you Hirano Nora?</font>

80
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:09,560
<font face="Calibri" size="51">But actually my clothes aren't even black, just navy blue</font>

81
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,590
<font face="Calibri" size="51">Will it be noticed?</font>

82
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:12,090
<font face="Calibri" size="51">It's night so it should be fine</font>

83
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,020
<font face="Calibri" size="51">Ari's clothes look cute right?</font>

84
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:18,370
<font face="Calibri" size="51">I bought it for when my relative had a wedding</font>

85
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:20,340
<font face="Calibri" size="51">I wonder if this is too flashy</font>

86
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:23,610
<font face="Calibri" size="51">Isn't that fine? It shows your grievance for the family</font>

87
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:26,280
<font face="Calibri" size="51">There's a loose thread at the back of your stockings though</font>

88
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,910
<font face="Calibri" size="51">Really? Oh no!</font>

89
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:31,110
<font face="Calibri" size="51">Why are your clothes so easy to tear?</font>

90
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:32,650
<font face="Calibri" size="51">How much will you put in the <i>goshugi</i>?</font>

91
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:34,250
<font size="36">TL note: <i>goshugi</i> is an envelope with money, given as gifts in weddings
<i>okoden</i> is the proper term for condolence money</font>

92
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,200
<font face="Calibri" size="51">It's not <i>goshugi</i>. it's <i>okoden</i></font>

93
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,220
<font face="Calibri" size="51">I'm giving 20,000</font>

94
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:39,550
<font face="Calibri" size="51">I only put in 10,000</font>

95
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:41,620
<font face="Calibri" size="51">Also it's bad to have the first number be divisible by 2</font>

96
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:43,160
<font face="Calibri" size="51">That's <i>goshugi</i></font>

97
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:47,710
<font face="Calibri" size="51">Actually, recently having it at 2 is like saying "Best of wishes to the both of you"</font>

98
00:04:48,700 --> 00:05:01,140
<font face="Calibri" size="51">I already told you, that's for <i>goshugi</i></font>

99
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:02,840
<font face="Calibri" size="51">We won't be accepting any offerings</font>

100
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:06,380
<font face="Calibri" size="51">But....even if you say that</font>

101
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:08,110
<font face="Calibri" size="51">Your thoughts and feelings are enough</font>

102
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,890
<font face="Calibri" size="51">I'll guide you inside</font>

103
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:18,480
<font face="Calibri" size="51">It's like we've earned something</font>

104
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:21,300
<font face="Calibri" size="51">Why don't you use it to repair your phone's screen</font>

105
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,540
<font face="Calibri" size="51">I wonder if Komiyama-san came by</font>

106
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,900
<font face="Calibri" size="51">I don't think so</font>

107
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:32,540
<font face="Calibri" size="51">I mean for a manager, Komiyama-san is a no-show when he's needed</font>

108
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:36,040
<font face="Calibri" size="51">I'll be calling them over, so please wait here</font>

109
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,700
<font face="Calibri" size="51">Onii-san, it looks like Chika's friends are here to see her</font>

110
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:58,660
<font face="Calibri" size="51">Thank you for coming all the way out here today on such a short notice</font>

111
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:01,640
<font face="Calibri" size="51">Please go ahead and light some incense</font>

112
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,680
<font face="Calibri" size="51">Samu's wake is empty</font>

113
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:47,510
<font face="Calibri" size="51">We probably came too late that's why everyone's already gone but,</font>

114
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:51,350
<font face="Calibri" size="51">even though we are lamenting the death of Samu,</font>

115
00:06:51,650 --> 00:07:17,350
<font face="Calibri" size="51">the emptiness just doesn't feel right.</font>

116
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:19,550
<font face="Calibri" size="51">You're all from Udagawa White Bears right?</font>

117
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,410
<font face="Calibri" size="51">Yes</font>

118
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:25,320
<font face="Calibri" size="51">Thank you for coming despite your busy schedules</font>

119
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:31,350
<font face="Calibri" size="51">Please go take a look at her face</font>

120
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:50,900
<font face="Calibri" size="51">Samu's.....already dead</font>

121
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:58,350
<font face="Calibri" size="51">I want to put something for her to be buried with, is it fine?</font>

122
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:00,850
<font face="Calibri" size="51">As long as it is something that can be burned</font>

123
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,010
<font face="Calibri" size="51">Samu liked this after all</font>

124
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:05,120
<font face="Calibri" size="51">No wait a moment</font>

125
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:05,460
<font face="Calibri" size="51">Samu liked <i>Takenoko no Sato</i>, you got it wrong</font>

126
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:08,480
<font size="36">TL note: bamboo shoot-shaped and mushroom-shaped chocolate by Meiji
<i>takenoko</i> = bamboo shoot | <i>kinoko</i> = mushroom</font>

127
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,100
<font face="Calibri" size="51">It was <i>Kinoko no Yama</i></font>

128
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:10,100
<font face="Calibri" size="51">I heard it was Choco Baby though</font>

131
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,300
<font face="Calibri" size="51">Any will do</font>

132
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:16,400
<font face="Calibri" size="51">It's not like she'll really be able to eat it</font>

133
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,200
<font face="Calibri" size="51">She might be able to in heaven</font>

134
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:20,470
<font face="Calibri" size="51">If it's heaven, then everything's there</font>

135
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:23,170
<font face="Calibri" size="51">There's no reason to specially take anything with her going there</font>

136
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:25,170
<font face="Calibri" size="51">I can get anything in heaven?</font>

00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:28,370
<font face="Calibri" size="51">That's what heaven is after all, you can eat and drink anything</font>

138
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:30,910
<font face="Calibri" size="51">Wait, heaven is above the clouds</font>

139
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:32,870
<font face="Calibri" size="51">There's no way food would be there</font>

140
00:08:33,290 --> 00:08:34,090
<font face="Calibri" size="51">Above the clouds?</font>

141
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:38,620
<font face="Calibri" size="51">My grandmother told me the people above that have nothing there just watch us, the ones below</font>

142
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:40,130
<font face="Calibri" size="51">Always?</font>

143
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:43,720
<font face="Calibri" size="51">While snickering, they watch our daily lives</font>

144
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:45,450
<font face="Calibri" size="51">All day long?</font>

145
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:49,060
<font face="Calibri" size="51">Rather than a day, more like year-long?</font>

146
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:52,200
<font face="Calibri" size="51">I wouldnt be able to do that if that was me</font>

147
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,800
<font face="Calibri" size="51">Isn't that just hell then?</font>

148
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:56,920
<font face="Calibri" size="51">Those kinds of feelings would disappear, if you're in heaven</font>

149
00:08:57,650 --> 00:08:59,340
<font face="Calibri" size="51">Like being paralyzed?</font>

150
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:02,110
<font face="Calibri" size="51">Yeah, like being given anesthesia</font>

151
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:03,310
<font face="Calibri" size="51">Anesthesia?</font>

152
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:06,450
<font face="Calibri" size="51">Somehow, heaven feels scary</font>

153
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,200
<font face="Calibri" size="51">Please help yourselves to the food</font>

154
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,250
<font face="Calibri" size="51">Thank you very much
-Take your time</font>

155
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:25,700
<font face="Calibri" size="51">I kinda feel sorry for looking like we came here to eat</font>

156
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:28,830
<font face="Calibri" size="51">But not eating would be rude too</font>

157
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:30,850
<font face="Calibri" size="51">We really are hungry after all</font>

158
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:32,200
<font face="Calibri" size="51">Well then</font>

159
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:37,180
<font face="Calibri" size="51">Sorry, I won't be drinking</font>

160
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,220
<font face="Calibri" size="51">Sumi, could you pass the orange juice?</font>

161
00:09:41,320 --> 00:10:03,720
<font face="Calibri" size="51">I didn't know alcohol was a no-go for you</font>

162
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,480
<font face="Calibri" size="51">Was the person awhile ago Samu's brother?</font>

163
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:06,870
<font face="Calibri" size="51">Probably</font>

164
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:09,250
<font face="Calibri" size="51">Wasn't he kinda cool?</font>

165
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:10,250
<font face="Calibri" size="51">I thought so too</font>

166
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:13,420
<font face="Calibri" size="51">A handsome guy with defined features</font>

167
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:16,250
<font face="Calibri" size="51">Seems like a beard would fit him right?
-Definitely</font>

168
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:18,390
<font face="Calibri" size="51">Like Mouri Kogoro</font>

169
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:21,600
<font face="Calibri" size="51">A moustache?
-I was thinking more of on the chin</font>

170
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,880
<font face="Calibri" size="51">Like (Daisuke) Jigen's?</font>

171
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:24,470
<font face="Calibri" size="51">No, shorter than that</font>

172
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:26,820
<font face="Calibri" size="51">Then, (Vinsmoke) Sanji's?</font>

173
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:30,640
<font face="Calibri" size="51">It's the one where it's connected from side to chin</font>

174
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:33,310
<font face="Calibri" size="51">Like Heidi's grandpa</font>

175
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:36,160
<font face="Calibri" size="51">That's a big beard, plus his hair's white</font>

176
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:38,710
<font face="Calibri" size="51">Like that but black</font>

177
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:41,380
<font face="Calibri" size="51">You must like those types a lot Ari</font>

178
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,520
<font face="Calibri" size="51">I get what you mean</font>

179
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:46,750
<font face="Calibri" size="51">Ari's always been attracted by looks alone</font>

180
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:50,480
<font face="Calibri" size="51">I like those that have really big beards</font>

181
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,430
<font face="Calibri" size="51">If I were to tell the truth,</font>

182
00:10:52,430 --> 00:11:04,370
<font face="Calibri" size="51">I don't have an interest in boys</font>

183
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:05,600
<font face="Calibri" size="51">Keep your hands in sync</font>

184
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:14,080
<font face="Calibri" size="51">Then, I'll be checking on each one of you</font>

185
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:17,500
<font face="Calibri" size="51">Keeping up?</font>

186
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,360
<font face="Calibri" size="51">Let's try it again?</font>

187
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:25,830
<font face="Calibri" size="51">It's hard isn't it?
-Yeah, it is</font>

188
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:28,780
<font face="Calibri" size="51">Nice and easy okay?</font>

189
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:36,700
<font face="Calibri" size="51">I'd find myself looking at girls ever since I was a kid</font>

190
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:39,900
<font face="Calibri" size="51">My romantic delusions also involved girls</font>

191
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:44,740
<font face="Calibri" size="51">I thought to myself that it was weird, so I kept it a secret from others</font>

192
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:51,480
<font face="Calibri" size="51">Then let's proceed to the next cut
- Got it</font>

193
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:56,490
<font face="Calibri" size="51">Then for the next cut, hold on to Samu who will be in the middle,</font>

194
00:11:56,490 --> 00:11:57,630
<font face="Calibri" size="51">and then Kimu to Momo,</font>

195
00:11:57,630 --> 00:12:01,100
<font face="Calibri" size="51">and Ari to Sumi, hug your partner from behind</font>

196
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:14,420
<font face="Calibri" size="51">Ari go to your position too</font>

197
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,510
<font face="Calibri" size="51">Get closer</font>

198
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:25,140
<font face="Calibri" size="51">Hold on tight</font>

199
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:30,460
<font face="Calibri" size="51">What's wrong?</font>

200
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:37,350
<font face="Calibri" size="51">Is it fine if we switch places?</font>

201
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:40,270
<font face="Calibri" size="51">I don't really mind</font>

202
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:46,270
<font face="Calibri" size="51">There</font>

203
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:51,550
<font face="Calibri" size="51">Sorry</font>

204
00:12:52,820 --> 00:13:31,650
<font face="Calibri" size="51">It's fine. I might sweat a lot</font>

205
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:32,510
<font face="Calibri" size="51">What's wrong?</font>

206
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:35,190
<font face="Calibri" size="51">Sumi's feeling sick</font>

207
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:36,920
<font face="Calibri" size="51">She's getting feverish</font>

208
00:13:37,290 --> 00:15:10,920
<font face="Calibri" size="51">You should get some rest</font>

209
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:13,750
<font face="Calibri" size="51">How is she? I brought a fever pad</font>

210
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:15,400
<font face="Calibri" size="51">Still sleeping</font>

211
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:20,600
<font face="Calibri" size="51">She looks like she's in pain</font>

212
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:23,130
<font face="Calibri" size="51">Yeah</font>

213
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:33,590
<font face="Calibri" size="51">Looking at her closely, Sumi really is pretty right?</font>

214
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:37,440
<font face="Calibri" size="51">Her face is small, and her eyelashes are long after all</font>

215
00:15:38,710 --> 00:16:00,070
<font face="Calibri" size="51">Is that so?</font>

216
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:01,870
<font face="Calibri" size="51">Komiyama-san still can't come</font>

217
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,240
<font face="Calibri" size="51">He's always away when he's needed</font>

218
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:06,170
<font face="Calibri" size="51">Is she okay?</font>

219
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:09,990
<font face="Calibri" size="51">I thought "So Samu was the same"</font>

220
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:12,980
<font face="Calibri" size="51">I also kept that as a secret</font>

221
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:22,710
<font face="Calibri" size="51">Hey, could we talk for a moment?</font>

222
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:24,130
<font face="Calibri" size="51">What is it?</font>

223
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:25,090
<font face="Calibri" size="51">Come over here</font>

224
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:42,580
<font face="Calibri" size="51">So you know...</font>

225
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:44,410
<font face="Calibri" size="51">is what happened awhile ago like that?</font>

226
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,180
<font face="Calibri" size="51">By that you mean..?</font>

227
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:49,050
<font face="Calibri" size="51">What you did to Sumi</font>

228
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:52,150
<font face="Calibri" size="51">The kiss</font>

229
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:55,020
<font face="Calibri" size="51">I did kiss her</font>

230
00:16:57,930 --> 00:17:01,100
<font face="Calibri" size="51">Are you like that too?</font>

231
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:01,950
<font face="Calibri" size="51">Like that..?</font>

232
00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:10,270
<font face="Calibri" size="51">You like women..?</font>

233
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:13,640
<font face="Calibri" size="51">Do I have to answer?</font>

234
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:19,610
<font face="Calibri" size="51">If possible, I'd like you to</font>

235
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:23,320
<font face="Calibri" size="51">Then I'll tell you</font>

236
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:26,720
<font face="Calibri" size="51">Not at all</font>

237
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:31,820
<font face="Calibri" size="51">The LGBT give off a fashionable sense right?</font>

238
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:37,300
<font face="Calibri" size="51">I thought it would've been better if I was</font>

239
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:38,570
<font face="Calibri" size="51">It's impossible</font>

240
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:40,770
<font face="Calibri" size="51">My heart doesn't go crazy for girls</font>

241
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:43,870
<font face="Calibri" size="51">I have always worried that I am weird</font>

242
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:46,110
<font face="Calibri" size="51">That being found out spelled the end for me</font>

243
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,010
<font face="Calibri" size="51">And here she goes talking about fashion sense</font>

244
00:17:53,010 --> 00:18:00,860
<font face="Calibri" size="51">Is that all? Let's go back</font>

245
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:02,860
<font face="Calibri" size="51">About this...</font>

246
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:04,160
<font face="Calibri" size="51">Don't tell anyone about it</font>

247
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:10,530
<font face="Calibri" size="51">What was that for?</font>

248
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:13,730
<font face="Calibri" size="51">It really is impossible</font>

249
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:15,430
<font face="Calibri" size="51">I don't feel anything at all</font>

250
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:28,450
<font face="Calibri" size="51">More than a sauce face, shouldn't it be a ketchup face?</font>

251
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:30,950
<font size="36">TL note: sauce face = western(/sharp/defined) facial features
ketchup face = a little less defined than sauce faces
Sauce in this case is worcestershire, and ketchup is strong but still milder in taste than worcestershire, hence the analogy</font>

252
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:31,900
<font face="Calibri" size="51">Ketchup?</font>

253
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:35,720
<font face="Calibri" size="51">It's strong like sauce, but a little more refreshing</font>

254
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:38,790
<font face="Calibri" size="51">Ketchup isn't really refreshing though</font>

255
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:41,430
<font face="Calibri" size="51">She really was a mysterious girl</font>

256
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:43,430
<font face="Calibri" size="51">Kissing others for no reason</font>

257
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:47,400
<font face="Calibri" size="51">Not thinking about the trouble her strange reasons may cause to the people around her</font>

258
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:51,040
<font face="Calibri" size="51">At the time of her death, disappearing by the truck's light</font>

259
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:54,710
<font face="Calibri" size="51">Samu was weird right?</font>

260
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:57,240
<font face="Calibri" size="51">Always doing weird things</font>

261
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:00,010
<font face="Calibri" size="51">I thought she was pretty cold to us</font>

262
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:02,310
<font face="Calibri" size="51">I mean, Samu can come from <i>samui</i>(cold)</font>

263
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:04,650
<font face="Calibri" size="51">I did say that before</font>

264
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:10,190
<font face="Calibri" size="51">She will be cremated tomorrow right?</font>

265
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:12,010
<font face="Calibri" size="51">Don't remind me</font>

266
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:14,360
<font face="Calibri" size="51">I mean isn't being burned horrible?</font>

267
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:17,430
<font face="Calibri" size="51">Being burned directly in a big incinerator</font>

268
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:21,550
<font face="Calibri" size="51">Then what do you prefer we do? A burial?</font>

269
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:26,570
<font face="Calibri" size="51">A burial is kinda scary as well, with the feeling of slowly rotting</font>

270
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,240
<font face="Calibri" size="51">Then, a wind funeral?</font>

271
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:29,760
<font face="Calibri" size="51">Wind funeral?</font>

272
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:34,060
<font face="Calibri" size="51">Let the body be taken by the water, in the end to be eaten by birds and other animals</font>
