110
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,400

00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,040
<font size="38">It rang.</font>

146
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,300
<font size="38">Oh. Is Ikuta!</font>

147
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,480
<font size="38">Moshi Moshi...</font>

148
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,720
<font size="38">Although she had no confidence in her personalities</font>

149
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,200
<font size="38">she was still managed to create a lot of memorable scenes, that's Ikuta.</font>

150
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:49,940
<font size="38">Please work hard towards the goal of becoming an essential member of the Shichifukujin!</font>

151
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:52,020
<font size="38">Ikuta. Congratulations!</font>

152
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:58,460
<font size="38">Which part of you do you think that was recognized by everyone?</font>

153
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:08,180
<font size="38">I never thought I had any kind of special personality or abilities at all.</font>

154
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:14,540
<font size="38">But since I'm selected, I'll still do my best.</font>

155
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:17,380
<font size="38">And I thought "This is a good matter for me."</font>

156
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:20,920
<font size="38">-Ah, is that right? Alright, do your best. -Congratulations!</font>

157
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:29,500
<font size="38">Alright, for now, there are already six members over here.</font>

158
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:32,920
<font size="38">-Only one slot for the Shichifukujin left. -Wow. Only one left.</font>

159
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:37,320
<font size="38">There is only one slot left for the new Nogizaka Shichifukujin,</font>

160
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:40,040
<font size="38">Who will be the last one to join?</font>

161
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,320
<font size="38">Hmm? Did it rang?</font>

162
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:49,200
<font size="38">-Eh!? -Oh!</font>

163
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:51,620
<font size="38">Hoshino?</font>

164
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:53,460
<font size="38">Hoshino Minami.</font>

165
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:54,600
<font size="38">Thank you very much.</font>

166
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,100
<font size="38">WOW!!</font>

167
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,180
<font size="38">It's Hoshino Minami.</font>

168
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:05,460
<font size="38">-She's in the Shichifukujin! -Thank you very much.</font>

169
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,620
<font size="38">-Congratulations! -Congratulations Minami.</font>

170
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:13,100
<font size="38">So three members did not make it in.</font>

171
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:19,640
<font size="38">Only 13 years old but already a Shichifukujin, Hoshino Minami.</font>

172
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:24,880
<font size="38">With her freshness personality and hidden abilities, she will become an impressive member.</font>

173
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,900
<font size="38">Congratulations!</font>

174
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:30,720
<font size="38">What is your feeling right now?</font>

175
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,860
<font size="38">I never thought that I would've make it.</font>

176
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:37,360
<font size="38">I even thought that I wouldn't make it into the senbatsu.</font>

177
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,980
<font size="38">But I'm really happy that I'm one of the Shichifukujin.</font>

178
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:42,000
<font size="38">Right. That's good.</font>

179
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:47,680
<font size="38">All of the new Nogizaka Shichifukujin members has been confirmed.</font>

180
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,680
<font size="38">Next up, there will be 9 slots left for the senbatsu.</font>

181
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:57,320
<font size="38">The previous Shichifukujin which is Ichiki, Nakada and Sakurai did not make it.</font>

182
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:01,460
<font size="38">That's right.</font>

183
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:02,860
<font size="38">Who is it?</font>

184
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,740
<font size="38">Oh! It's Kawamura!</font>

185
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,480
<font size="38">Congratulations.</font>

186
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:15,600
<font size="38">With her highly regarded dance skill, Kawamura.</font>

187
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:23,420
<font size="38">With her great dance moves and impressive performances, she is finally an official member.</font>

188
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:24,980
<font size="38">What is your feeling right now?</font>

189
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:27,820
<font size="38">-I'm really happy. -Really happy. -That's good.</font>

190
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:30,240
<font size="38">Give your best from now on ok?</font>

191
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:30,740
<font size="38">Yes.</font>

192
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:32,740
<font size="38">Alright, congratulations.</font>

193
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:34,120
<font size="38">That's good.</font>

194
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:38,360
<font size="38">The three previous Shichifukujin are still at the backstage.</font>

195
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,480
<font size="38">Ichiki, Nakada, and Sakurai.</font>

196
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,460
<font size="38">That's right.</font>

197
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:47,900
<font size="38">Will they ever make it into the senbatsu? A little worried.</font>

198
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:49,940
<font size="38">That will be really bad. Can they make it?</font>

199
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:55,380
<font size="38">Only 8 slots left and the ninth members will be...</font>

200
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,100
<font size="38">It rang. Who is that?</font>

201
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:00,420
<font size="38">-Who's that? -Who is that?</font>

202
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:02,760
<font size="38">Ah! It's Inoue.</font>

203
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:05,880
<font size="38">Oh! Inoue made it.</font>

204
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,860
<font size="38">Congratulations.</font>

205
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:15,740
<font size="38">Her energetic personality that keeps on shining no matter what, Inoue!</font>

206
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:20,400
<font size="38">Although she did not make it into the Shichifukujin, she made it into the senbatsu.</font>

207
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:22,040
<font size="38">Congratulations.</font>

208
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,160
<font size="38">Very frustrating.</font>

209
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:26,260
<font size="38">Very frustrating? Please tell us about your feeling right now.</font>

210
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:29,400
<font size="38">I'm frustrated.</font>

211
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:32,340
<font size="38">Why? What makes you frustrated?</font>

212
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:35,500
<font size="38">I had a higher goal than this.</font>

213
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:39,280
<font size="38">You hoped that your cellphone had rang earlier than this, is that right?</font>

214
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,280
<font size="38">-Yes. -Is that so?</font>

215
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,780
<font size="38">But I'd still made it into the senbatsu</font>

216
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47,820
<font size="38">so I'll do my best too.</font>

217
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:51,840
<font size="38">You can climb to the top from here.</font>

218
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:56,640
<font size="38">There is only seven slots left, who is going to be the tenth member?</font>

219
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:59,720
<font size="38">Ichiki, Nakada and Sakurai's cellphone did not ring at all.</font>

220
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,000
<font size="38">Will they ring?</font>

221
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,620
<font size="38">But....Oh? It rang. Who is it?</font>

222
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:07,680
<font size="38">Nishino!</font>

223
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,720
<font size="38">-Thank you very much. -It's from Nishino's cellphone.</font>

224
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:14,600
<font size="38">Gifted with the ability to draw</font>

225
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:14,600
<font size="38">and even became the first to have the "fashion leader" title.</font>

226
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:18,480
<font face="Times New Roman" size="32">{\an8}EP09 regarding the "fashion leader" title.</font>

227
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:23,600
<font size="38">The highly regarded Nishino Nanase. Congratulations on her making into the senbatsu!</font>

228
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,320
<font size="38">Your cellphone rang, right? What's your feeling at this moment?</font>

229
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,660
<font size="38">I'm really happy.</font>

230
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:33,380
<font size="38">That's good.</font>

231
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,740
<font size="38">Only 6 slots left!</font>

232
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:42,620
<font size="38">The original Shichifukujin still has three members...</font>

233
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:46,340
<font size="38">This is kinda unbelievable right now.</font>

234
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:50,920
<font size="38">Oh, it's Nakada!</font>

235
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,380
<font size="38">Nakada's rang!</font>

236
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:53,700
<font size="38">Moshi Moshi...</font>

237
00:15:55,800 --> 00:16:01,700
<font size="38">Yes, thank you very much.</font>

238
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:02,960
<font size="38">Thank you very much.</font>

239
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:09,200
<font size="38">Unfortunately she dropped out from the Shichifukujin</font>

240
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:13,760
<font size="38">But just like during the acting test, Nakada worked really hard until her tears fell.</font>

241
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:17,180
<font size="38">Congratulations on making into the senbatsu.</font>

242
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:23,800
<font size="38">I'm frustrated because I did not make it into the Shichifukujin.</font>

243
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:28,740
<font size="38">I kept thinking what if I didn't even make it into the senbatsu...</font>

244
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:30,740
<font size="38">What should I do after that?</font>

245
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,500
<font size="38">So I'm really happy that I made it into the senbatsu.</font>

246
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:41,160
<font size="38">Thank you, everyone.</font>

247
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,520
<font size="38">Only five slots left.</font>

248
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:48,580
<font size="38">Man...Ichiki and Sakurai.</font>

249
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:53,920
<font size="38">I wonder how they feel at this moment.</font>

250
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,080
<font size="38">It rang. Who is it?</font>

251
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:02,160
<font size="38">Who is it?</font>

252
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,320
<font size="38">-Oh?Sato? -Saito..?</font>

253
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:05,240
<font size="38">Saito Yuri!</font>

254
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:08,620
<font size="38">-Saito Yuri! -Thank you very much.</font>

255
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,740
<font size="38">Felt like she's lagging behind,</font>

256
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:18,840
<font size="38">but she actually gave her best silently, Saito Yuri.</font>

257
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:24,200
<font size="38">Working very hard even she's behind everyone, she finally made it into the senbatsu.</font>

258
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:28,220
<font size="38">I'm one of the "lagging-behind-dancing-trio" during the class.</font>

259
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:33,940
<font size="38">So I bought a bunch of dance lesson CDs</font>

260
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:36,500
<font size="38">and kept practicing at home.</font>

261
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:41,160
<font size="38">Lately, I received a few compliments saying that "I did great".</font>

262
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,620
<font size="38">Only 4 slots left!</font>

263
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:50,000
<font size="38">Oh? Who's that?</font>

264
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:56,740
<font size="38">-Saito Asuka! -Saito Asuka?</font>

265
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:58,080
<font size="38">Moshi mos..</font>

266
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:02,760
<font size="38">-I'll work hard, thank you very much. -After Saito Yuri is Saito Asuka.</font>

267
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:09,920
<font size="38">A little bit of childish aura, but her dancing skill is still highly regarded.</font>

268
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:14,360
<font size="38">Saito Asuka, congratulations on making into the senbatsu.</font>

269
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:17,180
<font size="38">I don't have any confidence at all.</font>

270
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:23,000
<font size="38">I don't really understand that which part of me is recognized by everyone.</font>

271
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,520
<font size="38">But I'm really happy that I'm in, so I don't want to think about them right now.</font>

272
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:31,320
<font size="38">Only 3 slots left.</font>

273
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:37,680
<font size="38">Ichiki and Sakurai have yet to be called, the two of the original Shichifukujin.</font>

274
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:40,760
<font size="38">It rang, who is it?</font>

275
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,460
<font size="38">-Ichiki? -It's Ichiki!</font>

276
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:47,840
<font size="38">Ichiki's cellphone rang!</font>

277
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:49,460
<font size="38">Moshi Moshi...</font>

278
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,400
<font size="38">Thank you very much.</font>

279
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:59,380
<font size="38">Thank you very much, thank you very much.</font>

280
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:02,260
<font size="38">The fourteenth members.</font>

281
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:08,680
<font size="38">Dropped out from the Shichifukujin,</font>

282
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:15,220
<font size="38">but because she's a jack of all trades she entered the senbatsu!</font>

283
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:19,740
<font size="38">I thought I won't made it.</font>

284
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,820
<font size="38">I'm really happy.</font>

285
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:31,260
<font size="38">I won't give up. I'll believe in myself and do my best.</font>

286
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:35,260
<font size="38">There's only two slots remaining.</font>

287
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:42,060
<font size="38">The only Shichifukujin member that did not receive a call yet is Sakurai.</font>

288
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:44,060
<font size="38">Will she receive a call?</font>

289
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,320
<font size="38">It rang. Who is it?</font>

290

<font size="38">-Oh! Noujo? -Noujo!</font>

291

<font size="38">-It's Noujo Ami. -Thank you very much.</font>

293
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,740
<font size="38">Noujo, who is almost giving up on the senbatsu.</font>

294
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:10,040
<font size="38">But during the show her actions showed us her unique charisma and she made it into the senbatsu!</font>

295
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:14,160
<font size="38">Honestly, I almost gave up.</font>

296
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:19,340
<font size="38">But I'm shocked to hear my phone rang.</font>

297

315
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:05,000

<font size="38">there are no more tears left to cry anymore.</font>

317
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:11,120
<font size="38">When Nakada was picked, you cried just like you entered the senbatsu.</font>

318
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:15,100
<font size="38">-Nakada. -Yeah, she's still crying.</font>

319
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:19,300
<font size="38">-Congratulations. -Congratulations Sakurai.</font>

00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:53,340
<font size="38">did not make it for once does not mean you're bad.</font>

327
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:56,160
<font size="38">Let's just give it a try, the debut single.</font>

328
00:22:56,160 --> 00:23:00,740
<font size="38">We're still testing the music</font>

329
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:08,480
<font size="38">And we have to consider the business collaboration with others. So that's why these members got picked.</font>

330
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:11,140
<font size="38">But really, it's still just the beginning of it.</font>

331
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:18,120
<font size="38">So we still have to consider who's better at this and who's not good at that kind of stuff.</font>

332
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:22,320
<font size="38">Please work hard and find out your own true color and let that color</font>

351
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:33,020
<font size="38">Honestly, this is my first time to have this kind of memory during Christmas.</font>

352
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:34,300
<font size="38">First time since I was born.</font>

353
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:36,060
<font size="38">It'll be the same for next year.</font>

354

362
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:26,700
<font size="38">The incomprehensible wishes of the members are...?</font>

363
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,020
<font size="38">Why did you laugh?</font>

364
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:30,020
