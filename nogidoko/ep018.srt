<font size="38">The unexpected results caused a big panic among the members!</font>

6
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:16,840
<font size="38">Everyone was like "Ehhh!!?"</font>

17
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:16,580
<font size="38">So with Shimada here that means our plan for today is...? Himura-san.</font>

<font size="38">Please read it while doing a funny face.</font>

20
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:34,040
<font size="38">Shuhei Shimada's curse! Who's Nogizaka46's most _____ member!?</font>

00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:40,920
<font size="38">The 16 senbatsu members will have their luck evaluated by Shuhei Shimada-san.</font>

22
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:46,280
<font size="38">With different themes, we'll determine who's Nogizaka46's most _____ member!</font>

23
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,940
<font size="38">The first theme will be</font>

24
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:52,680
<font size="38">The most likely member to become very rich.</font>

25
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,740
<font size="38">-I wanna become rich. -Who doesn't?</font>

26
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,860
<font size="38">The other might not be that important,</font>

27
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:01,080
<font size="38">but this luck is all that matters. -Yes, money is important.</font>

28
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:04,820
<font size="38">There's someone with a super-incredible luck for wealth.</font>

29
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:06,820
<font size="38">Better than anyone else.</font>

30
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:10,020
<font size="38">Please reveal the member who most likely to become rich!</font>

31
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:14,860
<font size="38">Who's the most likely to become rich among Nogizaka's members?</font>

32
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:16,220
<font size="38">It's Shiraishi-san.</font>

33
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:17,820
<font face="Times New Roman" size="32">{\an8}(Subber: You're really rich now 2k18.)</font>

34
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,200
<font size="38">Shiraishi! How do you feel now?</font>

35
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:27,000
<font size="38">-I'm really happy. -Wait Shiraishi what happened to you?</font>

36
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,880
<font size="38">I've caught a cold. -So you were sick since the past week?</font>

37
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:35,860
<font size="38">Her palm has a really good sign called the "millionaire sign."</font>

38
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:39,240
<font size="38">-What's this "millionaire sign?" -Really?</font>

39
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:43,080
<font size="38">From the "fate line," that's on the middle of the palm and straight down,</font>

40
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:49,240
<font size="38">and beside it there's this "money line," the longer the better.</font>

41
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:54,460
<font size="38">And going out from the pinky finger another "money line" to form a triangle shape.</font>

42
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:58,480
<font size="38">These together has the "millionaire sign," the "conqueror line." </font>

43
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:58,500
<font face="Times New Roman" size="30">Conqueror line. Best wealth luck.</font>

44
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,140
<font face="Times New Roman" size="30">t was said that Konosuke Matsushita might have this line too.</font>

45
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:02,500
<font size="38">Shiraishi's palm was the closest to the sign.</font>

46
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:10,440
<font size="38">Another good news, the "heart line" formed an arrow shape at the end.</font>

47
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:14,620
<font size="38">Both of the Bananaman has this line on them too.</font>

48
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:19,000
<font size="38">This is the "lucky charm sign." You'll bring good luck to anyone who stays around you,</font>

49
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,680
<font size="38">Like a Lucky Goddess.</font>

50
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:20,680
<font face="Times New Roman" size="30">Lucky charm sign. Able to discover and</font>

51
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,500
<font face="Times New Roman" size="30">improve others' hidden talents or charisma.</font>

52
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,760
<font size="38">If Shiraishi stayed with the group,</font>

53
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,520
<font size="38">the group will do well.</font>

54
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:32,800
<font size="38">She's probably like an essential member of this group.</font>

55
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,060
<font size="38">No..no..no...</font>

56
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:37,640
<font size="38">-It's cool. -We'll let you know when we wanna buy something.</font>

57
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,920
<font size="38">Buy a pair of sneaker for me ok?</font>

58
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:42,400
<font size="38">Buy me a sports jacket alright?</font>

59
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,440
<font size="38">Oh? The most suitable member to become the leader.</font>

60
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,920
<font size="38">Haven't decided who's gonna be the leader? -Yeah.</font>

61
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:54,740
<font size="38">There was a questionnaire for the member,</font>

62
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:58,640
<font size="38">you guys wrote the name down why don't just let her be the leader?</font>

63
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,500
<font size="38">-It's what everyone wished after all. -So who is it?</font>

64
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,160
<font size="38">Ummm... Sakurai. </font>

65
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:05,820
<font size="38">Oh, Sakurai. </font>

66
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:05,820
<font face="Times New Roman" size="32">{\an8}8 votes received out of 16 votes.</font>

67
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:08,020
<font size="38">But the palm reading said otherwise.</font>

68
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:13,120
<font size="38">Please look forward to who's going to be the leader according to the palm reading.</font>

69
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,640
<font size="38">The most suitable member to become the leader is...</font>

70
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,960
<font size="38">It's Inoue-san!</font>

71
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:26,200
<font size="38">Everyone was like "Ehhh!!?"</font>

72
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,100
<font size="38">What do you mean "Eh!" Inoue's not suitable?</font>

73
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,060
<font size="38">But it's still Inoue.</font>

74
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:35,680
<font size="38">The reason is that the horizontal line here called "heart line,"</font>

75
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,400
<font size="38">there are these small circles in front of it.</font>

76
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:45,800
<font size="38">Usually there's two to four circles, it's called the "insight line."</font>

77
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:45,800
<font face="Times New Roman" size="30">Insight line. Has a very good mind.</font>

78
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,000
<font face="Times New Roman" size="30">Able to act or see into a situation very fast.</font>

79
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,960
<font size="38">The power or act of seeing into a situation in a split second. </font>

80
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:52,500
<font size="38">It also means that your intuitions are always right.</font>

81
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,820
<font size="38">If you ever ask her something,</font>

82
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:57,700
<font size="38">she'll probably give you a good suggestion.</font>

83
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:05,840
<font size="38">The side of her thumb has two small lines, like these...</font>

84
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,500
<font size="38">that's the "charisma line."</font>

85
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:11,760
<font size="38">That name kinda makes you jealous, what a great name.</font>

86
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:11,760
<font face="Times New Roman" size="30">Charisma line. Good responsibility and righteous.</font>

87
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:11,940
<font face="Times New Roman" size="30">Loved by everyone. Good leadership.</font>

88
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:14,120
<font size="38">With the "charisma line" you can lead the others,</font>

89
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:16,080
<font size="38">and they will follow you.</font>

90
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:18,180
<font size="38">You also have good responsibility...</font>

91
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:20,260
<font size="38">and your palms are like the artist Eikichi Yazawa's*.</font>

92
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:21,200
<font face="Times New Roman" size="32">{\an8}Japanese famous singer-songwriter/rockstar.</font>

93
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,920
<font size="38">Even President Barack Obama has it.</font>

94
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:28,020
<font size="38">Don't worry in the future, just teach anyone a lesson as you liked.</font>

95
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:31,600
<font size="38">If they do not listen to you, show them your palm like this.</font>

96
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,740
<font size="38">I'm "The Charisma."</font>

97
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,040
<font size="38">The next theme will be...</font>

98
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:43,100
<font size="38">The one who'll do well even if she's not an idol.</font>

99
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:47,140
<font size="38">Maybe like an actress or a model etc.</font>

100
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:52,640
<font size="38">The member who'll do well even if she's not an idol is...</font>

101
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:58,060
<font size="38">-Saito Asuka-san! -Really!?</font>

102
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:03,080
<font size="38">The middle of "wisdom line" has an obvious branch.</font>

103
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:08,440
<font size="38">-It's called the "writer line," which means you have high literary skill.</font>

104
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:08,440
<font face="Times New Roman" size="30">Writer line. The best sign for the writers.</font>

105
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:08,980
<font face="Times New Roman" size="30">Has a creative mind.</font>

106
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:13,740
<font size="38">She'll probably publish a book and become a writer.</font>

107
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:17,280
<font size="38">It means she's very creative. </font>

108
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:20,720
<font size="38">She probably has a lot of good ideas inside her head.</font>

109
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:24,220
<font size="38">Does that mean you're good at writing?</font>

110
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:25,760
<font size="38">I participated in an Advocate Contest* once. </font>

111
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,040
<font face="Times New Roman" size="32">{\an8}(Nationwide Essays Contest.)</font>

112
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:31,320
<font size="38">Is it the one you have to recite? -Yes, an essay writing contest,</font>

113
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:34,580
<font size="38">I was the representative of somewhere I think.</font>

114
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,000
<font size="38">Forgot the most crucial info.</font>

115
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,200
<font size="38">Now I really wanna know where were you representing for!</font>

116
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:41,160
<font size="38">There's another interesting line,</font>

117
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:45,340
<font size="38">the "money line" shifted to the right side over here.</font>

118
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:48,400
<font size="38">This is the "beauty line." She has awareness for beauty.</font>

119
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:50,400
<font size="38">Like Uno Kanda-san, IKKO-san, Tsubasa Masuwaka-san.</font>

120
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:50,400
<font face="Times New Roman" size="30">Beauty line. Wit and artistic. </font>

121
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,400
<font face="Times New Roman" size="30">Suitable to have beauty-related works.</font>

122
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:58,400
<font size="38">-You might have a secondary job! -Yeah there's a chance!</font>

123
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:03,240
<font size="38">-ASUKA Brand Fake Eyelashes or something else. -Oh not bad!</font>

124
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,840
<font size="38">How old are you currently?</font>

125
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,840
<font size="38">I'm 13 years old.</font>

126
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:11,920
<font size="38">If you have a business at this age, it'll be really scary.</font>

127
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,520
<font size="38">I said not suitable but that's not all,</font>

128
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:19,020
<font size="38">it means there's another talents to be found out. But...</font>

129
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:23,160
<font size="38">let's talk about who's the most suitable to become an idol. Vocation as an idol.</font>

130
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:26,040
<font size="38">-There's something like that? -Yes.</font>

131
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:30,940
<font size="38">-It's Ikoma-san. -Ikoma-san!</font>

132
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:32,760
<font size="38">The reason? What line affected that?</font>

133
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:38,620
<font size="38">From "life line," to "wisdom line," until "heart line," they formed an M-shape.</font>

134
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:45,600
<font size="38">There's a lot who has this M-shape, which means that the current job is suitable for her.</font>

135
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,960
<font face="Times New Roman" size="30">Vocation line. The current job is suitable for that person.</font>

136
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:52,160
<font size="38">So they actually has this line in Palmistry?</font>

137
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:56,380
<font size="38">So at the end of the "fate line," there's a branch over here.</font>

138
00:07:56,380 --> 00:08:01,260
<font size="38">This is what Idol needed the most. "Fame line" and "demand line."</font>

139
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:01,560
<font size="38">-That's so powerful! -What a great line!</font>

140
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:01,560
<font face="Times New Roman" size="30">Fame line. A must have for a famous idol or artists.</font>

141
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,520
<font face="Times New Roman" size="30">Able to attract opposite sex. Seductive.</font>

142
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:07,980
<font size="38">AKB48's Tomomi Itano-san has a long line of this. </font>

143
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:11,200
<font size="38">But Ikoma's pretty long too.</font>

144
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,040
<font size="38">The bottom of her index finger has a curve.</font>

145
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:20,060
<font size="38">This is "ring of Soloman," aka "ring of luck."</font>

146
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:22,640
<font size="38">But unexpectedly, she has two of it!</font>

147
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:23,080
<font face="Times New Roman" size="30">Ring of Soloman. Indicates that the person is very lucky.</font>

148
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,700
<font size="38">-Eh? Ikoma has them? -Yes.</font>

149
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,040
<font size="38">It's a good news. You'll earn a lot of money.</font>

150
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,440
<font size="38">So good things will happen? What will happen?</font>

151
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,440
<font size="38">Like, win a lottery?</font>

152
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:36,000
<font size="38">Let's go to our next theme.</font>

153
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:40,560
<font size="38">The member that everyone should be careful of.</font>

154
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:43,100
<font size="38">-What does this mean? -A dangerous person?</font>

155
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:47,180
<font size="38">It's more like, she's too concerned about what's happening around her.</font>

156
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:50,000
<font size="38">So everyone had to take care and protect her.</font>

157
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:52,780
<font size="38">Ah! So it's an annoying person?</font>

158
00:08:55,280 --> 00:09:00,060
<font size="38">Nobody wanted to be called. Who's the member that the others need to beware of?</font>

159
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,440
<font size="38">It's Ichiki-san!</font>

160
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,140
<font size="38">Ichiki looks very gentle.</font>

161
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:14,080
<font size="38">-She looks like an obedient child. -Yeah, a good child.</font>

162
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,600
<font size="38">First of all, there's a lot of lines.</font>

163
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,440
<font size="38">There's a lot of gully too.</font>

164
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:26,240
<font size="38">-The lines are everywhere. -There's gully here and there.</font>

165
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:30,580
<font size="38">These lines represented how much stuffs you're thinking of at once.</font>

166
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:32,580
<font size="38">She's always concerned of what's happening around her.</font>

167
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:33,700
<font face="Times New Roman" size="30">Gully line. Emotional. Often cares too much.</font>

168
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,820
<font size="38">She's emotional.</font>

169
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:41,120
<font size="38">Not just the good things, she also cares about the bad things.</font>

170
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:46,400
<font size="38">So that's the reason why she's so emotional.</font>

171
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:49,340
<font size="38">The "wisdom line" represented how she thinks.</font>

172
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:53,080
<font size="38">There's a sharp turn over here.</font>

173
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:59,160
<font size="38">The bigger the curve, the more emotional she can get.</font>

174
00:09:59,580 --> 00:09:59,840
<font face="Times New Roman" size="30">Wisdom line with a big curve. Cared too much. Easily overwhelmed.</font>

175
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:03,080
<font size="38">It also means that she's easily overwhelmed.</font>

176
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:06,580
<font size="38">If you're already depressed and you get overwhelmed again</font>

177
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:08,580
<font size="38">there's no chance the others can comfort her.</font>

178
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:13,020
<font size="38">My mom always tells me... Ah sorry for the voice...</font>

179
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:17,240
<font size="38">How were you all overworked this badly?</font>

180
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:23,480
<font size="38">My mom told me that "When you are that sad, nothing will comfort you."</font>

181
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,140
<font size="38">So you were told before.</font>

182
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:27,860
<font size="38">Ok let's say that there's a job today</font>

183
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:30,900
<font size="38">instead of thinking "Hmmm, I did well." and "Not bad."</font>

184
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:34,380
<font size="38">you'll think about "What if I did that, will it be better?" and "That's really bad."</font>

185
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:35,880
<font size="38">-Yes, I do.</font>

186
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,880
<font size="38">Me too.</font>

187
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:44,960
<font size="38">This part of the "heart line" went up like this.</font>

188
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:51,020
<font size="38">The bigger the curve, the easier to become agitated.</font>

189
00:10:53,340 --> 00:11:00,820
<font size="38">Emotional and easily agitated really sound like an annoying person.</font>

190
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:05,760
<font size="38">But this curve also indicates that she has good potential.</font>

191
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:05,760
<font face="Times New Roman" size="30">Heart line that goes up. Easily agitated but it </font>

192
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,540
<font face="Times New Roman" size="30">will become a good ability if controlled well.</font>

193
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:10,240
<font size="38">So everyone must be really nice to her. </font>

194
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:12,360
<font size="38">Make her thinks that she's doing ok.</font>

195
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:15,380
<font size="38">Must protect at all cost.</font>

196
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:15,380
<font size="38">Koji Tamaki* has these too.</font>

197
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:18,140
<font face="Times New Roman" size="32">{\an8}Japanese singer-songwriter.</font>

198
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:18,320
<font size="38">-Yabai. That's yabai. -You should be careful.</font>

199
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:22,040
<font size="38">Similar?</font>

200
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:25,820
<font size="38">Will you go home suddenly during a live performance?</font>

201
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:28,940
<font size="38">Or got engaged all of a sudden?</font>

202
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,540
<font size="38">It's here.</font>

203
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:37,940
<font size="38">The most pervert member.</font>

204
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:43,120
<font size="38">Kinda embarrassing if called out, but who's the most pervert member?</font>

205
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,060
<font size="38">It's Ikuta-san!</font>

206
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,560
<font size="38">Ikuta? You have a pure face. This is unexpected.</font>

207
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:58,620
<font size="38">-No, it's not true. -Your palms betrayed you.</font>

208
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:02,200
<font size="38">-There's no such thing. -No more excuse. It's the truth.</font>

209
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,520
<font size="38">What's the meaning of this?</font>

210
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:09,260
<font size="38">Overall there's no clear lines. But...</font>

211
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:11,600
<font size="38">the "ero line" was the only clear line.</font>

212
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,220
<font face="Times New Roman" size="30">Ero line. Able to attract opposite sex easily using her charisma.</font>

213
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:16,700
<font size="38">This curve over here is the "ero line."</font>

214
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:21,800
<font size="38">Somehow there's more. Two lines...three lines.</font>

215
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,700
<font size="38">There's a lot!</font>

216
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:27,560
<font size="38">-Ikuta you little pervert~ -It's not true.</font>

217
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:30,020
<font size="38">Were you looking at me with perverted eyes all the time?</font>

218
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:34,720
<font size="38">You're the one with the perverted eyes!</font>

219
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,060
<font size="38">Who has this line too?</font>

220
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:40,500
<font size="38">-Noujo-san has it. -Noujo.</font>

221
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:44,180
<font size="38">-Noujo has this "ero line." -Eh...what to do.</font>

222
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,880
<font size="38">They are the perverted duo.</font>

223
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,720
<font size="38">There's a lot of artists with this "ero line."</font>

224
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:49,720
<font size="38">For example Masaharu Fukuyama* has it.</font>

225
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:53,220
<font face="Times New Roman" size="32">{\an8}Japanese musician, singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist and actor.</font>

226
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,080
<font size="38">AKB48's Atsuko Maeda-san has a few of this line.</font>

227
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:05,340
<font size="38">Suddenly this line became a good thing.</font>

228
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:08,680
<font size="38">So let's continue to the next theme.</font>

229
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,020
<font size="38">The weirdest member?</font>

230
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:15,280
<font size="38">Weirdest? What's this?</font>

231
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:21,620
<font size="38">A weird person...and she might even become an abnormal person.</font>

232
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:21,640
<font size="38">Pervert? If it's about pervert could it be Saito Yuri?</font>

233
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:26,220
<font face="Times New Roman" size="32">{\an8}變態. "Abnormal" and "pervert" shares the same Kanji. So it could be either meaning.</font>

234
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:31,860
<font size="38">Who's the weirdest member among Nogizaka46!?</font>

235
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:32,720
<font size="38">It's Hashimoto-san!</font>

236
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,160
<font face="Times New Roman" size="32">{\an8}(Subber: Yes, this is correct. You're weird Miss.Hashimoto.)</font>

237
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:41,760
<font size="38">The "ero line" we discussed was like this.</font>

238
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:46,840
<font size="38">But Hashimoto-san's was small compared to it.</font>

239
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,840
<font size="38">It's very clear and it's very rare.</font>

240
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,840
<font size="38">The "abnormal line."</font>

241
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:57,440
<font size="38">"Abnormal line?" Are you abnormal?</font>

242
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,460
<font size="38">How's that, Hashimoto?</font>

243
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:01,460
<font size="38">How are you abnormal?</font>

244
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:04,240
<font size="38">Not at all, I'm a normal person.</font>

245
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:05,760
<font size="38">The way she thinks might be different than the others, she also has different focus point.</font>

246
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:09,640
<font face="Times New Roman" size="30">Abnormal line. Has different ways of thinking than the others.</font>

247
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:14,540
<font size="38">As an artist, you'll have advantages if you can think out of the box.</font>

248
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:15,380
<font face="Times New Roman" size="30">The member with the best overall luck in 2012.</font>

249
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:16,760
<font size="38">It's here. </font>

250
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:22,400
<font size="38">-Everyone wants this title, right? -I really want it.</font>

251
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:26,560
<font size="38">-Best luck for this year. -Who's it gonna be?</font>

252
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:31,580
<font size="38">Who's going to be the member that has the best of luck in 2012?</font>

253
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:37,120
<font size="38">Who's going to be the member that has the best of luck in 2012?</font>

254
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,420
<font size="38">It's Saito Yuri!</font>

255
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:44,820
<font size="38">-Saito Yuri appeared over here!?</font>

256
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,120
<font size="38">Eh really!?</font>

257
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:56,780
<font size="38">Around the "fate line," there's a split over here that formed this shape.</font>

258
00:14:56,780 --> 00:15:00,200
<font size="38">-Like a "fish?" -Yes, like a "fish."</font>

259
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:04,260
<font size="38">The "fate line" describes your life and a "fish" over there means good things will come into your life.</font>

260
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:05,740
<font size="38">So it means good things will come to you.</font>

261
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:07,580
<font face="Times New Roman" size="30">Fish line. Good things will happens.</font>

262
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:10,940
<font size="38">And you might experience it during 2012.</font>

263
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:16,320
<font size="38">-I'm really happy! -So jealous of you~</font>

264
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:22,120
<font size="38">So does this mean this "fish" will appeared on other lines too?</font>

265
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:27,440
<font size="38">Yes. If it's on "wisdom line" it will boost your working luck.</font>

266
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:31,780
<font size="38">If it's on "marriage line" it means your marriage will be good.</font>

267
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:36,260
<font size="38">If it's on "good line" it means many good things will happen to you.</font>

268
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:39,560
<font size="38">But to have it appeared on "fate line" is the best.</font>

269
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:48,480
<font size="38">The luckiest member during 2012 is Saito Yuri.</font>

270
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,900
<font size="38">Who doesn't know their reading yet?</font>

271
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:55,180
<font size="38">Actually, I intentionally put Matsumura's at last.</font>

272
00:15:56,140 --> 00:16:01,400
<font size="38">There's this long horizontal line.</font>

273
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,900
<font size="38">Both of her palms has it. -Both of hers?</font>

274
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,740
<font size="38">What line is this?</font>

275
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:08,260
<font size="38">-Masukake line? -Yes. Masukake line.</font>

276
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:11,340
<font size="38">-Nani? Nani? -This is a great line.</font>

277
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:14,240
<font size="38">Actually, Nakada-san has this line too.</font>

278
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:14,720
<font size="38">There's rumors of Tokugawa Ieyasu* having this line too. The "sign of world domination."</font>

279
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,460
<font face="Times New Roman" size="32">{\an8}(He was the head of the Tokugawa Clan. One of the three unifiers of Japan, along with his former lord Oda Nobunaga and Toyotomi Hideyoshi.)</font>

280
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:18,460
<font face="Times New Roman" size="30">Masukake line. World domination sign.</font>

281
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:22,120
<font face="Times New Roman" size="30">Rumors of Tokugawa Ieyasu has this line too.</font>

282
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:25,300
<font size="38">Amazing! She has the "sign of world domination!"</font>

283
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:29,180
<font size="38">But why she doesn't have a good luck for this year.</font>

284
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:35,660
<font size="38">Usually, the person with "Masukake line" tend to do things at their own pace,</font>

285
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:37,900
<font size="38">And will not bother to listen others' suggestions.</font>

286
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:39,800
<font size="38">So if that person go astray the situation will become dangerous.</font>

287
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,780
<font face="Times New Roman" size="30">Masukake line. Tend to do things at her own pace.</font>

288
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:44,180
<font size="38">It's like a double-edged sword.</font>

289
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:46,220
<font size="38">So she'll go astray easily if she's not careful?</font>

290
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:48,520
<font size="38">But if everything's good you'll become like them...</font>

291
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:52,580
<font size="38">Masaharu Fukuyama, Masatoshi Hamada, and Mana Ashida.</font>

292
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:03,120
<font size="38">Who else has not seen their reading yet?</font>

293
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:09,280
<font size="38">Takayama-san. After I finished her reading I thought it was really good from another aspect.</font>

294
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:15,000
<font size="38">What's the shocking truth behind Takayama's palm reading!!?</font>

295
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:21,780
<font size="38">Takayama-san...after I finished the reading I thought it was really good from another aspect.</font>

296
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:26,120
<font size="38">After looking at her palm I had a conclusion.</font>

297
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:28,120
<font size="38">"THE·NORMAL."</font>

298
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:30,120
<font size="38">Totally normal.</font>

299
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,880
<font size="38">You're really something else. "The·Normal."</font>

300
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,880
<font size="38">She has very standard palms.</font>

301
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,880
<font size="38">I thought so too.</font>

302
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:44,540
<font size="38">Her palms are so standard that they can be used as a golden guideline for Palmistry.</font>

303
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:50,880
<font size="38">Not about palm reading. But an earlier today a temporary leader was announced.</font>

304
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,840
<font size="38">We'll announce who's going to be the captain.</font>

305
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,780
<font size="38">Sakurai Reika.</font>

306
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:03,220
<font size="38">Loved by everyone, now she's the temporary leader for Nogiazka46.</font>

307
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:11,680
<font size="38">I'll do my best to unite Nogizaka46!</font>

308
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:15,860
<font size="38">Everyone, yoroshiku onegaishimasu.</font>

309
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,860
<font size="38">There's only less than a month before their debut single - Guruguru Curtain.</font>

310
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:28,320
<font size="38">CD will be divided into three edition. The CD cover and the songs inside will be different.</font>

311
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,860
<font size="38">It'll be A, B, and C edition. </font>

312
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:37,500
<font size="38">Inside them are all 33 members' self-directed performance special videos.</font>

313
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,860
<font size="38">Which means...</font>

314
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:45,620
<font size="38">we're going to reveal some of the special videos!</font>

315
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:48,440
<font size="38">No more waiting, please enjoy!</font>

316
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:53,200
<font size="38">Forward! Hashimoto!</font>

317
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:56,120
<font size="38">Just like everyone else they greet the morning,</font>

318
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:58,820
<font size="38">I, Hashimoto Nanami greet the morning as well!</font>

319
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:02,860
<font size="38">First, open the curtains and prepare for the day.</font>

320
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:05,720
<font size="38">I thought I was prepared but that's not the case.</font>

321
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:08,120
<font size="38">"When I'm going to become an adult."</font>

322
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:11,420
<font size="38">I love swimming. I'm good at frog style swimming.</font>

323
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:16,520
<font size="38">I become happy whenever I swim.</font>

324
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,800
<font size="38">Lately, I started to learn English,</font>

325
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:24,820
<font size="38">so I can have a conversation with you in the future.</font>

326
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,860
<font size="38">My name is Erika. </font>

327
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:28,340
<font size="60">Oh!</font>

328
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:30,320
<font size="60">Goddamn!!</font>

329
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:46,740
<font size="38">With the help of world's top director,</font>

330
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:48,440
<font size="38">they created these scenes.</font>

331
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,640
<font size="38">Ikoma Rina.</font>

332
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,640
<font size="38">What's your height?</font>

333
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,180
<font size="38">153cm.</font>

334
00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:00,380
<font size="38">Tsutsumi Yukihiko, a director that participated in a lot of famous works,</font>

335
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:03,420
<font size="38">and there are lot more special videos to look forward to!</font>

336
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:07,280
<font size="38">Debut single - Guruguru Curtain, available on February 22nd!</font>

337
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,020
<font size="38">Also...</font>

338
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:15,620
<font size="38">Nogizakatte, Doko? will have a public recording session on February 12th.</font>

339
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:20,940
<font size="38">Do you want to meet Nogizaka46? Register before the deadline!</font>

340
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,280
<font size="38">After this, we'll reveal the latest finished song!</font>

341
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:32,640
<font size="38">This is the recording of "Nogizaka no Uta", one of the songs in their debut single.</font>

342
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:37,360
<font size="38">The director is the dance teacher, Minami Sasuga-sensei.</font>

343
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:41,040
<font size="38">What does the teacher have in mind for this?</font>

344
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:45,380
<font size="38">This time...I wrote a story.</font>

345
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:49,580
<font size="38">Everyone's working hard on their own</font>

346
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:54,220
<font size="38">and slowly they developed teamwork, and it will not be easily shaken. </font>

347
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:59,180
<font size="38">"It's better instead of working hard all alone by yourself."</font>

348
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:01,420
<font size="38">I wanted that message to be noticed by the fans.</font>

349
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:05,120
<font size="38">To capture those precious moments,</font>

350
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:12,280
<font size="38">we'll use real footage of them working hard and becoming more teamwork.</font>

351
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:16,140
<font size="38">What do the members think of the director's idea?</font>

352
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:21,880
<font size="38">The staff also told us that, even if we faced hardship before,</font>

353
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:29,480
<font size="38">all of us have to continue to work hard together towards our debut.</font>

354
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:34,360
<font size="38">Everyone showed all kinds of thoughts and emotions,</font>

355
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:37,180
<font size="38">and some of them even cried.</font>

356
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,880
<font size="38">That's the point.(The MV)</font>

357
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:42,100
<font size="38">There's when we danced,</font>

358
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:46,920
<font size="38">and ran around the scenes.</font>

359
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:52,640
<font size="38">Sometimes it felt bad when you tired of running.</font>

360
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:54,160
<font size="38">when we're doing seiza*, we tried really hard to do it perfectly.</font>

361
00:21:54,160 --> 00:22:00,480
<font face="Times New Roman" size="32">{\an8}正座 or 正坐, literally "proper sitting". The Japanese term for one of the traditional formal ways of sitting in Japan.</font>

362
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:05,420
<font size="38">This video will show the true side of Nogizaka46.</font>

363
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:09,380
<font size="38">It's not a simple video.</font>

364
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:15,120
<font size="38">After this, the first reveal of "Nogizaka no Uta."</font>

365
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:38,680
<font size="38"><i>Where is Nogizaka?</i></font>

366
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:43,140
<font size="38"><i>We came here without knowing anything,</i></font>

367
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:50,020
<font size="38"><i>We were just looking for an undefined dream.</i></font>

368
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:57,620
<font size="38"><i>"If we go there, will we find it?"</i></font>

369
00:22:57,620 --> 00:23:01,860
<font size="38"><i>We asked someone that's ahead of us,</i></font>

370
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:08,800
<font size="38"><i>By the time we realized it, we had climbed the hill.</i></font>

371
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:16,960
<font size="38"><i>Our flowing sweat and worn out bodies,</i></font>

372
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:23,360
<font size="38"><i>Our overflowing tears and an unclear picture of the future,</i></font>

373
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,480
<font size="38"><i>These are called life. </i></font>

374
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,640
<font size="38"><i>Planting our feet on the ground,</i></font>

375
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,720
<font size="38"><i>We'll steadily walk on.</i></font>

376
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:43,060
<font size="38"><i>The pure blue sky,</i></font>

377
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:47,180
<font size="38"><i>The wind blowing by,</i></font>

378
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:53,080
<font size="38"><i>The song of Nogizaka.</i></font>

379
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:03,360
<font size="38"><i>Even if you choose a path that looks easy,</i></font>

380
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:07,820
<font size="38"><i>In life, there are no shortcuts.</i></font>

381
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:14,020
<font size="38"><i>To become stronger, we climb the hill. </i></font>

382
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,440
<font size="38">Next week, Nogizaka46's members will go all across the country.</font>

383
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:20,940
<font size="38">I like SKE48 more.</font>

384
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:25,280
<font size="38">Promoting their own songs in the middle of a snow.</font>

385
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,580
<font size="38">Lots of situations appeared while they were doing promotions!</font>

386
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:32,560
<font size="38">Also a touching reunion.</font>

387
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:52,840
<font size="38">What hardship did they face?</font>
