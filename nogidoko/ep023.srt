<font size="38">Tonight, a close-up documentary about Nogizaka46's pre-debut era.</font>

2
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:11,720
<font size="38">The hardships they endured during their difficult days.</font>

3
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:16,740
<font size="38">Louder! Louder!</font>

4
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:18,200
<font size="38">That's strict.</font>

5
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:24,040
<font size="38">What's the biggest problem they faced before their debut?</font>

6
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:32,900
<font size="38">Nogizakatte, Doko?</font>

00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:32,900

00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:54,380
<font size="38">Don! Nogizakatte, Doko? has started! We're the MC - Bananaman!</font>

12
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:57,420
<font size="38">Yoroshiku Onegaishimasu!</font>

13
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:01,540
<font size="38">So, every member showed up, except those who took a sick leave!</font>

14
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:03,900
<font size="38">Nogizaka46's members!</font>

15
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:08,060
<font size="38">-Yoroshiku Onegaishimasu! -There's a lot of them.</font>

16
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,020
<font size="38">You guys were incredible lately!</font>

17
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:13,020
<font size="38">Thank you very much.</font>

18
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:15,860
<font size="38">You guys appeared on every channel.</font>

19
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:23,160
<font size="38">Congratulations on your 2nd place on the Oricon's Weekly Chart!</font>

20
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:26,760
<font size="38">That's incredible!</font>

21
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:29,840
<font size="38">Why did everyone show up for today?</font>

22
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,320
<font size="38">Nogizaka46 was formed around August last year, right?</font>

23
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:37,320
<font size="38">So what's the song title again? Bichabicha Curtain(wet curtain)?</font>

24
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:45,840
<font size="38">Guruguru Curtain was the one that got the 2nd place on the Oricon.</font>

25
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:51,700
<font size="38">From the formation of the group until now, how did you guys deal with it?</font>

26
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:57,240
<font size="38">We're going to use a video to conclude it, so everyone can see your growth.</font>

27
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:00,840
<font size="38">Tokyo Minato-ku. Nogizaka.</font>

28
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:05,680
<font size="38">Countless artists once started their careers at this place.</font>

29
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:12,840
<font size="38">Among them, it's the official rival of AKB48 - Nogizaka46!</font>

30
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:21,160
<font size="38">These were the 154 days of training for their debut single.</font>

31
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:30,180
<font size="38">August 2011, the final evaluation for Nogizaka46.</font>

32
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:39,060
<font size="38">56 finalist were selected from 38,934 candidates for the final evaluation.</font>

33
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:42,680
<font size="38">I come from Yurihonjo, Akita.</font>

34
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:46,600
<font size="38">Both Natsuki Kato and Shu Watanabe came from Yurihonjo too.</font>

35
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:51,520
<font size="38">I would like to become the third artist that came from Yurihonjo.</font>

36
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:55,800
<font size="38">Hello everyone, my name is Shiraishi Mai.</font>

37
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,780
<font size="38">I like to eat sweet potato,</font>

38
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,860
<font size="38">and my favorite sauce is mayonnaise.</font>

39
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:00,420
<font face="Times New Roman" size="32">{\an8}U gonna regret saying that, Maiyan</font>

40
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:04,620
<font size="38">After serious evaluation, they announced the starting members.</font>

41
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:09,560
<font size="38">Ikoma Rina, please come in front.</font>

42
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:13,840
<font size="38">Entry No.3, Ichiki Rena.</font>

43
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:19,180
<font size="38">Nogizaka46 was formed with 33 members.</font>

44
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:23,540
<font size="38">They're going to give their best along the way for their CD debut.</font>

45
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:31,880
<font size="38">Two weeks after the announcement, members have started their first dance lesson.</font>

46
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:39,360
<font size="38">Members started their first dance lesson with unease and nervous feelings.</font>

47
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,840
<font size="38">With the help from their teacher, they put their maximum effort to it.</font>

48
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:50,560
<font size="38">After their lesson, they heard some unexpected feedback from their teacher.</font>

49
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:55,500
<font size="38">After looking at everyone, the most obvious aura I felt was,</font>

50
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,340
<font size="38">you guys thought you're still in school.</font>

51
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:03,460
<font size="38">Even with that kind of basic learning consciousness, it was far from enough.</font>

52
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:06,440
<font size="38">Since everyone set their goal to debut,</font>

53
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:11,800
<font size="38">you guys should have shown us your professionalism during the lessons.</font>

54
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,820
<font size="38">Not only you have to learn the moves,</font>

55
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:19,420
<font size="38">you have to learn how to engage with the audience, express yourself.</font>

56
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:27,040
<font size="38">The place they're standing is not a playground, it's a serious entertainment stage.</font>

57
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:33,140
<font size="38">They  learned the ways to engage with the audience during their first lesson.</font>

58
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:40,000
<font size="38">Next up, a mandatory skill for a CD debut, the singing lessons started.</font>

59
00:04:46,020 --> 00:05:01,760
<font size="38">Firstly, the members had to perform songs, one by one in front of their teachers.</font>

60
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,280
<font size="38">Is that the best from you?</font>

61
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,320
<font size="38">-Hmm? -Is that the best you got?</font>

62
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,320
<font size="38">I accidentally looked down.</font>

63
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,800
<font size="38">Can I sing one more time?</font>

64
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,740
<font size="38">Sorry, we don't have much time, next.</font>

65
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:16,560
<font size="38">I'm Saito Chiharu, I'm going to sing now.</font>

66
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:19,800
<font size="38">-Can you tell me your name again? -I'm Saito Chiharu.</font>

67
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,140
<font size="38">-Again. -I'm Saito Chiharu.</font>

68
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:24,660
<font size="38">-Again. -I'm Saito Chiharu.</font>

69
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:26,700
<font size="38">Again, louder this time, be energetic.</font>

70
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:29,000
<font size="38">-I'm Saito Chiharu. -Louder.</font>

71
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,840
<font size="38">I'm Saito Chiharu. -Louder!!</font>

72
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:34,440
<font size="38">-I'm Saito Chiharu!! -Yes, that felt more energetic.</font>

73
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:38,520
<font size="38">If you want to leave an impression, you have to be energetic like you did just now.</font>

74
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:48,400
<font size="38">If you're nervous, you can move your body a bit.</font>

75
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:56,160
<font size="38">How do you express yourself when everyone can see your face?</font>

76
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,820
<font size="38">Undoubtedly everyone gets nervous on the stage.</font>

77
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:02,680
<font size="38">But if you show your nervousness out, you'll look like an amateur.</font>

78
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,680
<font size="38">Everyone here wanted to become a pro artist right?</font>

79
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:08,260
<font size="38">So that's why even when you're nervous you have to express yourself more.</font>

80
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:10,520
<font size="38">I know you were nervous earlier.</font>

81
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,680
<font size="38">But please do your training.</font>

82
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:15,340
<font size="38">So, let's continue.</font>

83
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:17,340
<font size="38">Imagine yourself on a stage.</font>

84
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:19,760
<font size="38">Imagine yourself on a stage!</font>

85
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:24,500
<font size="38">As a professional artist and as a performer,</font>

86
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,560
<font size="38">fooling around is not allowed.</font>

87
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:31,460
<font size="38">The members had to go through a harsh lessons step by step.</font>

88
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:34,620
<font size="38">After their lesson,</font>

89
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:39,260
<font size="38">today we have something important to announce.</font>

90
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:44,620
<font size="38">Nogizaka46's first variety show has been decided.</font>

91
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:49,760
<font size="38">But not everyone can participate in the show.</font>

92
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:56,220
<font size="38">After the combinations of training and official poll,</font>

93
00:06:56,220 --> 00:07:00,040
<font size="38">they selected these members to participate.</font>

94
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:03,980
<font size="38">Here it is, the first ever recording of the show has started.</font>

95
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,280
<font size="38">No please, it's embarrassing.</font>

96
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:23,820
<font size="38">Their first variety show debut, and their first own show.</font>

97
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:28,660
<font size="38">Before the appearance, the members were nervous behind the scene.</font>

98
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,820
<font size="38">I'm really nervous now, yabai.</font>

99
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:38,040
<font size="38">I'm super nervous, no idea what should I do now.</font>

100
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:41,400
<font size="38">Gambarimasu! I'm going to do my best.</font>

101
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:44,500
<font size="38">Alright, welcome!</font>

102
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:55,020
<font size="38">Everyone waved at us, thank you very much.</font>

103
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,940
<font size="38">The talks between Bananaman relieved the members' nervousness.</font>

104
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:03,700
<font size="38">Members started to talk more, and the recording finished without a hinge.</font>

105
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:06,360
<font size="38">Actually, we have a big announcement to make.</font>

106
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:11,180
<font size="38">Nogizaka's Shichifukujin.</font>

107
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:20,560
<font size="38">Unexpectedly, they were going to announce the Shichifukujin members during their second recording.</font>

108
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,920
<font size="38">Shiraishi Mai-san!</font>

109
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,440
<font size="38">Sakurai Reika!</font>

110
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,580
<font size="38">Ikoma Rina!</font>

111
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:39,320
<font size="38">I had no confidence in myself.</font>

112
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:46,260
<font size="38">I thought I'm not worthy to be the one standing here.</font>

113
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,440
<font size="38">After the announcement of Nogizaka's Shichifukujin,</font>

114
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:55,640
<font size="38">they started to work towards their debut, the interaction between fans also started.</font>

115
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:58,520
<font size="38">Their first ever event, the members designed their own posters for the meeting event.</font>

116
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:03,760
<font face="Times New Roman" size="32">{\an8}Doiya-san</font>

117
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:07,260
<font size="38">This was the first time the members interacted with their fans.</font>

118
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:12,340
<font size="38">The members formed a circle to boost their energy.</font>

119
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:16,260
<font size="38">Is everyone energized? OOOOYYEEEAAHHHH!!</font>

120
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:16,300
<font size="38">one two, "Doryoku, kansha, egao, uchira wa Nogizaka noborizaka FORTY-SIX!"</font>

121
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:30,160
<font face="Times New Roman" size="32">{\an8}Translation: Effort, gratitude, and smiles! We’re the 46 who are going to ascend Nogizaka!</font>

122
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:36,240
<font size="38">To shorten the distance between them, the members introduced themselves one by one.</font>

123
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:40,020
<font face="Times New Roman" size="32">{\an8}From: The Phantom of the Opera - Think of Me.</font>

124
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:48,720
<font size="38"><i>"Think of me, think of me fondly When we've said goodbye."</i></font>

125
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:53,220
<font size="38">Although I read tons of books when I was a child,</font>

126
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:59,300
<font size="38">I still love the Galileo·Galilei Biography I read when I was in fourth grade.</font>

127
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:05,040
<font size="38">The book had shaped me into the person I am today.</font>

128
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:12,500
<font size="38">Next up, some unique interactions between members and fans.</font>

129
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:20,160
<font size="38">Speed drawing of the fans in a limited time.</font>

130
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:25,760
<font size="38">Nishino who's really good at drawing finished her artwork very quickly.</font>

131
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:33,000
<font size="38">The oldest member, Iwase also drew some good drawing.</font>

132
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:42,000
<font size="38">Other members also finished their own unique artwork.</font>

133
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:56,280
<font size="38">Next up was the message recording session from the members.</font>

134
00:10:56,280 --> 00:11:00,600
<font size="38">I like you, always!</font>

135
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:10,020
<font size="38">Good morning, the sun came out, time to get up!</font>

136
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:18,340
<font size="38">Thanks for the hard work, do your best for tomorrow too!</font>

137
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:24,640
<font size="38">As the Nogizaka's Shichifukujin, the members went through 4 months of activities.</font>

138
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,040
<font size="38">There's another announcement...</font>

139
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:35,720
<font size="38">February 22nd is going to be Nogizaka46's CD debut date.</font>

140
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:44,420
<font size="38">Next up, the senbatsu of 16 members for the CD debut.</font>

141
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:51,680
<font size="38">Unexpectedly, they're going to reveal the 16 senbatsu members for the debut on the show.</font>

142
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:55,220
<font size="38">Cellphones will be used.</font>

143
00:11:55,220 --> 00:12:01,280
<font size="38">Those who got selected, will receive a call from the management team.</font>

144
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:04,580
<font size="38">Those who did not receive a call will not make it into the senbatsu.</font>

145
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:08,320
<font size="38">First up, the Shichifukujin's!</font>

146
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:17,240
<font size="38">Shiraishi's phone is ringing!</font>

147
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,840
<font size="38">Thank you very much.</font>

148
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,560
<font size="38">The next Shichifukujin.</font>

149
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,820
<font size="38">Oh! Who's it? Matsumura?</font>

150
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:48,800
<font size="38">Ehh...how do I say...</font>

151
00:12:57,180 --> 00:13:00,040
<font size="38">More new Shichifukujin appeared...</font>

152
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:14,500
<font size="38">Ikoma Rina, Takayama Kazumi, Ikuta Erika also made it into Shichifukujin.</font>

153
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:21,140
<font size="38">Unexpectedly, there are 3 new Shichifukujin members that joined the ranks.</font>

154
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:26,500
<font size="38">Next up, Nogizaka46's hardest trial yet!</font>

155
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:38,300
<font size="38">After the senbatsu, the members started to work towards their final goal!</font>

156
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:43,880
<font size="38">Announcement! Nogizaka's going to do Meiji's commercial deal.</font>

157
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:49,060
<font size="38">Nobody expected themselves to have a Meiji's commercial.</font>

158
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:55,100
<font size="38">Nogizaka46 has officially debuted into commercial deal!</font>

159
00:13:56,520 --> 00:14:01,120
<font size="38">They did all kind of promotions around the country.</font>

160
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:08,500
<font size="38">At the same time, the lessons for the debut single and CW song did not stop at all.</font>

161
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:14,420
<font size="38">Following their working schedules, they shot a PV.</font>

162
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:19,320
<font size="38">They also finished the recording work.</font>

163
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:25,220
<font size="38">For the first time ever, the members experienced overloaded works/schedules.</font>

164
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:28,780
<font size="38">The members were battling against pressure and uneasiness.</font>

165
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:31,680
<font size="38">Although they were determined to carry on,</font>

166
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:36,500
<font size="38">but they started to become exhausted at the same time, one by one.</font>

167
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:40,660
<font size="38">Finally, on the day of their recording, Hashimoto was sick.</font>

168
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:45,760
<font size="38">Because of her extreme nervousness, she was suffering from hyperventilation.</font>

169
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:52,420
<font size="38">She couldn't do anything but rest.</font>

170
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:59,320
<font size="38">But it was the recording day for their song "Guruguru Curtain."</font>

171
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:03,240
<font size="38">One member's absent might caused a big trouble to the rest.</font>

172
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:07,340
<font size="38">"I'm not the only one that's going through a hard time."</font>

173
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:10,820
<font size="38">Hashimoto seems to hear her teammates' inner voice.</font>

174
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,880
<font size="38">She went back to finish the recording.</font>

175
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:19,580
<font size="38">Going through a hard time altogether,</font>

176
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:22,100
<font size="38">they thought of their responsibilities and each other,</font>

177
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:25,600
<font size="38">Nogizaka46's was one step closer to become professional artists.</font>

178
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:35,260
<font size="38">Around January, Nogizaka46's members arrived at AKB48's live show.</font>

179
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:41,260
<font size="38">They performed "Guruguru Curtain" during AKB48's concert.</font>

180
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:46,920
<font size="38">It was Nogizaka46's first time to be performing in front of the audiences.</font>

181
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:55,060
<font size="38">The members felt extremely nervous for their first live performance.</font>

182
00:15:55,840 --> 00:16:02,320
<font size="38">Meanwhile, the other members that are not in the senbatsu stayed at the backstage to cheer on them.</font>

183
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:06,940
<font size="38">We're on the same boat. So even though we're not performing our heart beats together.</font>

184
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:15,840
<font size="38">10, 9..."Doryoku, kansha, egao, uchira wa Nogizaka noborizaka FORTY-SIX!"</font>

185
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:22,780
<font size="38">Finally, Nogizaka46 went up to the stage full of nervousness.</font>

186
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:30,800
<font size="38">Everyone, good evening! 1, 2, We're Nogizaka46!</font>

187
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:47,740
<font size="38">The senbatsu members sang their song in front of audiences without being nervous.</font>

188
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:56,340
<font size="38">The members on stage were performing for everyone that supported and cheered for them.</font>

189
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:06,880
<font size="38">Those who could not make it to the stage also cheered for the members on stage.</font>

190
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:16,880
<font size="38">Finally, Nogizaka46 finished "Guruguru Curtain" in front of AKB48's fans.</font>

191
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:24,920
<font size="38">We, as Nogizaka46, has a goal we would like to surpass.</font>

192
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,920
<font size="38">The goal is...</font>

193
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:35,900
<font size="38">The goal is... AKB48.</font>

194
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:44,640
<font size="38">We'll work hard and do our best so we could become AKB48's real rival.</font>

195
00:17:44,640 --> 00:18:08,440
<font size="38">Everyone, please support us!</font>

196
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:15,380
<font size="38">After that, "Guruguru Curtain" achieved the 2nd place on Oricon Weekly Chart!</font>

197
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:22,600
<font size="38">But Nogizaka46 just debuted recently.</font>

198
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:28,440
<font size="38">They only started their first step of a long journey towards the top of the hill.</font>

199
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:35,520
<font size="38">To surpass their target, to the top of the hill, to reach beyond the horizon.</font>

200
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:45,960
<font size="38">With thankful and hardworking thoughts and the smile on their face,</font>

201
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:52,380
<font size="38">Nogizaka46's going full speed towards the higher goals!</font>

202
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:06,760
<font size="38">So from the look of it, everyone did their best to carry on.</font>

203
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:11,420
<font size="38">So what's the harshest experience for each different members?</font>

204
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:15,040
<font size="38">Let's talk about that. Firstly, Takayama.</font>

205
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:23,940
<font size="38">For me, before we have our own songs, I could not sing during events.</font>

206
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:27,060
<font size="38">Because you guys have no songs yet?</font>

207
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:34,080
<font size="38">Yes, so we have to learn how to do talks, it's very hard.</font>

208
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:40,320
<font size="38">Indeed, right? You must be able to talk all of a sudden, with no prior experience.</font>

209
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,760
<font size="38">But at least you kinda know how to talk now, right?</font>

210
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,600
<font size="38">Yeah, kinda now...</font>

211
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,740
<font size="38">Hashimoto, what do you think about her talking skill?</font>

212
00:19:52,740 --> 00:20:00,580
<font size="38">She can now talk very smoothly even without any scripts.</font>

213
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:03,100
<font size="38">So you already surpassed me.</font>

214
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,900
<font size="38">You're competent. x2</font>

215
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:07,900
<font size="38">Next up, Matsumura.</font>

216
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:15,900
<font size="38">During Meiji's commercial filming, I'm not a senbatsu member,</font>

217
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:24,580
<font size="38">Everyone was filming, but I'm not the senbatsu member so I finished my filming part very quickly.</font>

218
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:31,780
<font size="38">Because they filmed for the whole day, and I went in the lounge to wait for them.</font>

219
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:35,800
<font size="38">So when I heard them laughing and having fun, I became sad and cried.</font>

220
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:42,020
<font size="38">When I heard their happy voices, I realized that I finished my part very quickly.</font>

221
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:45,880
<font size="38">It was kinda sad.</font>

222
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:55,720
<font size="38">Well, everything has two sides, the happy part, and the sad part...</font>

223
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,720
<font size="38">Nanamin~~</font>

224
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:00,920
<font size="38">Eh, what happened?</font>

225
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:03,780
<font size="38">Hashimoto looks like she's gonna cry too.</font>

226
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:06,540
<font size="38">Sorry, I feel like crying too.</font>

227
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:09,080
<font size="38">We faced the same problem.</font>

228
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:11,400
<font size="38">I understand the pain.</font>

229
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,940
<font size="38">But I still love the members,</font>

230
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:15,880
<font size="38">so I thought was there another way?</font>

231
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:20,700
<font size="38">I love them so much, but there's no place to release my anger.</font>

232
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:23,960
<font size="38">Why not just hire a staff as a sandbag for you to punch.</font>

233
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:31,020
<font size="38">After this, another big announcement!</font>

234
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:43,340
<font size="38">Because I Don't Want to Lose You / Ushinaitaku Nai Kara</font>

235
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:53,840
<font size="38"><i>I was surrounded by the sound of cicada's cries,</i></font>

236
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:58,360
<font size="38"><i>The summer fever spread throughout the schoolyard</i></font>

237
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:03,460
<font size="38"><i>Your white shirt and grey skirt</i></font>

238
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:08,360
<font size="38"><i>Heartrendingly wavering at me like a mirage</i></font>

239
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:12,340
<font size="38"><i>Within my heart</i></font>

240
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:16,880
<font size="38"><i>A wind silently begins to blow</i></font>

241
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:22,680
<font size="38"><i>My true thoughts are suddenly stirring</i></font>

242
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:31,260
<font size="38"><i>People fall in love because they don't want to be alone</i></font>

243
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:38,580
<font size="38"><i>Pretending to tie the laces on my Converses</i></font>

244
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:43,460
<font size="38"><i>But I was really looking at you the whole time</i></font>

245
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:48,800
<font size="38"><i>My thirst had been quenched</i></font>

246
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:55,240
<font size="38"><i>But somehow I'm always sinking Into the desert of my heart</i></font>

247
00:22:56,780 --> 00:23:01,240
<font size="38">Guruguru Curtain's worldwide handshake event has started!</font>

248
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:08,380
<font size="38">Their first event attracted around 5 thousands people!</font>

249
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:14,620
<font size="38">I had a dream since I was a kid that I'll be able to perform in front of a lot of people</font>

250
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:18,460
<font size="38">I achieved that dream today, I'm really happy.</font>

251
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:21,020
<font size="38">Next up, the dream stage.</font>

252
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:24,260
<font size="38">Please listen next, "Guruguru Curtain."</font>

253
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:35,980
<font size="38">The live performance was a big hit! The members continued to work towards their dreams!</font>

254
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:40,080
<font size="38">Congratulations, Guruguru Curtain achieved 2nd place.</font>

255
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,080
<font size="38">Thank you very much.</font>

256
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:49,740
<font size="38">So since you have the first single, of course, there'll be the second single.</font>

257
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:55,420
<font size="38">So next week, senbatsu announcement for the second single!</font>

258
00:23:56,900 --> 00:24:01,960
<font size="38">It's really fast, right? Ikoma's already in tears.</font>

259
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:04,500
<font size="38">It's coming.</font>

260
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:07,980
<font size="38">But that's Nogizaka46 for you right?</font>

261
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:12,020
<font size="38">Finally, senbatsu for their second single!</font>

262
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:19,780
<font size="38">Next week, senbatsu for their second single!</font>

263
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:24,000
<font size="38">More shocking and unexpected results than the previous single's senbatsu!</font>

264
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:28,700
<font size="38">I'm getting goosebumps.</font>
