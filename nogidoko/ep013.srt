<b>Inspiration Game~</b>

46
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:42,180
<b>Five members of each team will have to give an answer</b>

47
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,270

<b><i>First up is Team Grey led by Kano-san</i></b>

51
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:02,790
<b>Captain Kano from Team Grey</b>

52
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:07,200
<b>I think this team will not use their brain and just say whatever comes through their mind</b>

53
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:10,250
<b>Alright, do your best</b>

54
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:14,770
<b>Anyways, the first question for Team Grey is this:</b>

55
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:17,190
<b>What do you eat for lunch at school ?</b>

56
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:23,340
<b>About this question, we're talking school food only or can it be popular foods ?</b>

57
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:25,110
<b>No, only school food please.</b>

58
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:32,580
<b>It must be different when we talk about a public shcool, right</b>

59
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:34,390
<b>Nowadays ?</b>

60
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:40,100
<b>I heard that in the city there are menus which you can choose from</b>

61
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:44,440
<b>At my place (Sendai) lunch was already prepared and you couldn't choose but it was good.</b>

62
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:48,710
<b>Well to each time period its own foods</b>

63
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:50,790
<b>For example Himura-san only ate <i>kinomi</i></b>

64
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:53,280
<b>Are we talking about serving temperature too ?</b>

65
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:55,860
<b>What do you mean?</b>

66
00:03:56,290 --> 00:04:01,440
<b>Whether eating a cold serve, half cold, or hot...</b>

67
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,870
<b>It shouldn't matter ! - This is incredible</b>

68
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:08,460
<b>The number one served lukewarm meal in the popular meal menu, what could it even be ?</b>

69
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:13,700
<b>Your Captain always says things that no one understands.</b>

70
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:15,020
<b>Anyways I think I've decided</b>

71
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:20,300
<b>Your boards are messed up now because of Kano-san</b>

72
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:25,480
<b>Now, please show us your answers !</b>

73
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,440
<b>Open please</b>

74
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:30,970
<b>Curry, Agepan, Curry, Curry, Curry</b>

75
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:36,170
<b>Do schools still give Agepan nowadays ?</b>

76
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:39,390
<b>They do, many members here like it right?</b>

77
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:40,090
<b>Yes...</b>

78
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:41,880
<b>They really likes that</b>

79
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,920
<b>We don't know about it</b>

80
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:45,820
<b>Is there no agepan in kansai?</b>

81
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:46,520
<b>There's not</b>

82
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,970
<b>Others that have a different menu in school?</b>

83
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:51,710
<b>In Aichi we've got Bibimbap</b>

84
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:00,250
<b>I did not have any rice in school</b>

85
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:02,220
<b>Mushrooms were just too good, right ?</b>

86
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:04,260
<b>They didn't provide rice ?</b>

87
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:04,920
<b>Yes, they didn't</b>

88
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,390
<b>Your kidding.
So what did you eat ?</b>

89
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:07,830
<b>I loved Koppepan</b>

90
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:10,180
<b>You just took your koppepan like that and....</b>

91
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:15,200
<b>No no, they served other foods with it of course, small ones, large ones...</b>

92
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,860
<b>What kind of school did you go to ?!</b>

93
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:20,570
<b>Anyways they did pretty good, 4 points all in all.</b>

94
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:23,890
<b>Next question is this</b>

95
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,450
<b>Speaking of songs 
What song is the most popular in karaoke ?</b>

96
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:31,000
<b>Easy one</b>

97
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:34,750
<b>But there might be different answers</b>

98
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:37,970
<b>About this

99
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:40,070
<b>Please stop your dirty joke</b>

100

<b>This was a really popular song
Everyone could sing it</b>

101
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:51,760
<b>Kano did you sing too ?</b>

102
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:53,170
<b>Yes I did</b>

103
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,680
<b>What's wrong ?</b>

104
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:01,240
<b>They think you're disgusting</b>

105
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,520
<b>While singing, do you dance as well ?</b>

106
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,280
<b>Everyone will dance to it, definitely</b>

107
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:07,460
<b>You also include dancing, Kano</b>

108
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,610
<b>Yes it's dancing</b>

109
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:12,690
<b>Let's look at the answers, starting with Kano</b>

110
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,910
<b>Kano-san answer is....</b>

111
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:16,190
<b>"Heavy Rotation"</b>

112
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,740
<b>It's a disaster if you sing it</b>

113
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,020
<b>Matsumura what's your answer</b>

<b>Golden Bomber's...</b>

<b>Ahhh, It's awesome.

<b><i>With their attention-grabbing performance, the visual-kei air band, Golden Bomber</i></b>

122
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:03,140
<b>Didn't you say you must also dance while singing this song ?</b>

123
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,400
<b>Hence, enjoy Kano-san dance for Heavy Rotation !</b>

124
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,520
<b>Wrong !</b>

125
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,180

<b>They definitely do not like ugly comedians, right ?</b>

00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,120
<b>That's right ?</b>

132
00:07:56,270 --> 00:08:08,760
<b>So many ugly comedians out there...</b>

133
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:13,180
<b>The <i>Really</i> ugly comedian and ugly comedian ?
