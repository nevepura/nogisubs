187
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,960
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Because I didn't know who was Stevenson ..</font>

188
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:14,190
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Because you didn't know who was he, you wrote him down as the answer? Opposite style of answering?</font>

193
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,820
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">You added an 'n' consonant into the answer?</font>

194
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,960
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">In comparison, Nakada's answer, here</font>

197
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:40,760

199
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:48,480
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">I didn't know how, so I just wrote what I think it was spelled as and it ended up as Stevenberg</font>

200
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,180
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">You just renamed Steven Spielberg</font>

201
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:53,000
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Everyone just added a 'n' consonant at the end eh?</font>

202
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,340
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Well there aren't really many Steves ..</font>

203
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:56,400
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">They probably thought the answer wouldn't start with Steve</font>

204
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:56,870
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">They definitely thought the 'n' consonant needed to be included</font>

205
00:09:56,870 --> 00:10:00,700
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">They thought the answer would definitely not contain 'Steve'</font>

206
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:03,010
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Answers also went all the way to 'Steven'</font>

<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Lets take a look at Ikoma's answer</font>

264
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:41,210
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Sorry, but could you pass me that plate that has the fried squid? I want to eat that.</font>

265
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,530
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">You wanted to eat that right?</font>

266
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:44,720
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">The last part was cute</font>

267
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,560
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">This is hilarious!</font>

268
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,560
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">The last part about you wanting to eat the fried squid was cute</font>

269
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,180
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">This is almost totally correct right?</font>

270
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:54,310
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">In another context this is correct</font>

271
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:58,060
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">The next question is this</font>

272

<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Make a sentence using the phrase "A piece of cake"</font>

274
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:03,180
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Shiraishi</font>

275
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:10,020
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">A piece of cake, grandma out in the fields with a scythe collecting the tea leafs</font>

276
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:13,540
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">This is funny!</font>

277
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,650
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">This is interesting!</font>

278
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:17,190
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">What do you mean by this sentence?</font>

279
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:23,470
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">I thought it was a grandma growing tea leafs out in the fields</font>

280
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:27,800
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">And she uses the scythe to harvest the tea leafs .. I don't know ..</font>

281
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:31,540
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">You meant the collection action of the tea leafs?</font>

282
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:32,680
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Ahh so thats what it meant</font>

283
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,480
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Oh, collecting the tea leafs, I see what you meant</font>

284
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:38,950
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">This isn't something to cheer about!</font>

285
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:42,250
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">You've got it wrong you know, even though you Yay-ed</font>

286
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:45,330
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Next is the test of imagination!</font>

287
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:50,010
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Complete the Senryu which starts with "The truth is"</font>

288

<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Nagashima</font>

289
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:58,220
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">The truth is, it would be bad if I do not slim down. But I still ate.</font>

290
00:13:58,220 --> 00:13:59,820
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">But you continued to eat despite that!</font>

291
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:04,140
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Instead of "But I want to eat" you said "Thats why I ate"</font>

292
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:05,410
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">But you still ate!</font>

293
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:10,000
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">To be fat is really unsightful you know</font>

294
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:12,340
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">You are not one to talk!</font>

295
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,500
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">But its the truth, if you're fat, there isn't any good outcomes</font>

296
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:25,000
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Next up is the test of the member's expressiveness</font>

297
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:30,480
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">The girls have to draw something based on the given topic to express themselves, only relying on what they remember of it</font>

298
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:35,500
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">For the first theme, this is the task</font>

299
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:37,910
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">A kangaroo!</font>

300
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:41,310
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">They need to hold back while drawing this</font>

301
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:42,990
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">No one shouldn't draw this wrongly</font>

302
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:45,120
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Well then, first up, Nishino</font>

303
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:48,310
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Nishino you are good at art right?</font>

304
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:50,910
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Nishino's drawing, here</font>

305
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:56,210
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">You're good!</font>

00:14:56,210 --> 00:14:58,300
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">The drawing is good and cute too!</font>

307
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:01,000
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">This is really good!</font>

308
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:02,640
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Whats the noticing point of this drawing?</font>

309
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,870
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Its large legs</font>

310
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:07,780
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">She also drew the baby in the mother Kangaroo's pouch</font>

311
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:10,800
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">In the pocket right?</font>

312
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,240
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">You're good at this, really</font>

313
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:16,040
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">It looks cute too</font>

314
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:18,950
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Next up, Hashimoto</font>

315
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,480
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Hashimoto, you seem like you are good at art</font>

316
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,140
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">You seem like you are able to calmly observe objects</font>

317
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:26,560
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Well then lets take a look, here</font>

318
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:30,930
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">What is this?!</font>

319
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:33,240
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">What is this!</font>

320
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,320
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Where does it's legs bend at?</font>

321
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,980
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Scary scary scary scary!!</font>

322
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,820
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">It looks like its carrying its child in a bucket!?</font>

323
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:44,260
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Actually, I study in an arts university</font>

324
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,390
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Say what?</font>

325
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:46,570
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">What did you say?!</font>

326
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:47,230
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">I study in an arts university</font>

327
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:48,270
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">ARTS UNIVERSITY?!</font>

328
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:49,270
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Please stop going!</font>

329
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:50,390
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">You're kidding me right?</font>

330
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:51,780
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">You study in an arts university?!</font>

331
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:53,870
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">What do you study in university?</font>

332
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,310
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Spatial Design</font>

333
00:15:56,180 --> 00:16:00,890
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">You don't seem to be capturing any spatial design in this</font>

334
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:02,150
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">If I have a design template</font>

335
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:03,730
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">So if you have a template, you're good at it?</font>

336
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:05,040
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Well, average ..</font>

337
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,300
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">So your drawing becomes like that if you don't have a template</font>

338
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:11,690
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">This would be good as a T-Shirt design</font>

339
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,420
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Next up, Ikoma!</font>

340
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:16,070
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Ikoma's kangaroo, lets take a look!</font>

341
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:20,400
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">It looks like its talking</font>

342
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,610
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Its saying something</font>

343
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:24,300
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">What is it saying?</font>

344
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:26,800
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Its saying "Teriku Teriku"</font>

345
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:27,990
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Teriku teriku?</font>

346
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:30,840
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">It has an adam's apple</font>

347
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,150
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">When you zoom out and look at the entire picture</font>

348
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:35,590
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">It seems like theres a nest</font>

349
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:38,320
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Inside the nest, it seems like</font>

350
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,650
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">there are 2 baby kangaroos that look the same as the father kangaroo</font>

351
00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:47,550
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">They are similar as the father kangaroo, crying out Teriku teriku</font>

352
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,520
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Is it the kangaroo's children?</font>

353
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,640
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">They are the kangaroo's children</font>

354
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,100
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">They are the kangaroo's children right?</font>

355
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:51,840
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Yes they are</font>

356
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:55,000
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">But the one in the father kangaroo's pouch is different!</font>

357
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,320
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Its a rabbit!</font>

358
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,800
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Its cute!</font>

359
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,600
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">-This is different from the others right? 
-This is a rabbit stuffed toy</font>

360
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,890
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Stuffed toy?!</font>

361
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:03,920
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Why did you draw a stuffed toy inside the kangaroo's pouch?</font>

362
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:07,690
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">I wanted to draw it's child but ended up drawing a rabbit</font>

363
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:08,500
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">I see</font>

364
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,380
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">You wanted to draw the child but ended up drawing a rabbit right ~ ?</font>

365
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:18,400
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">The task to draw a kangaroo turned out like this, lets move on to the next task</font>

366
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,280
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">The next task is this!</font>

367
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:25,010
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Ahh .. well this is difficult I guess, who knows?</font>

368
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:26,660
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Would they know about this?</font>

369
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:28,940
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">First up, Nishino!</font>

370
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:32,450
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">First of all, lets take a look at Nishino's Sphinx</font>

371
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:33,300
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Here it is!</font>

372
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:37,630
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Wow its good!</font>

373
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:39,560
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Its a little scary</font>

374
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:43,800
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Its face looks a little manly but you've managed to capture the main features of the Sphinx</font>

375
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,350
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">I can tell its the Sphinx</font>

376
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:46,240
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">You're good at drawing</font>

377
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,120
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Next, shall we look at art student Hashimoto's drawing?</font>

378
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,350
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Well, you do belong to an arts university</font>

379
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:51,360
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Please draw this well</font>

380
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,120
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Hashimoto's sphinx, here</font>

381
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,540
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">What is this?!</font>

382
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:03,270
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">This looks like it has been drawing by a little boy</font>

383
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:06,020
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Next up is .. Ikuta</font>

384
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:07,790
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Ikuta's Sphinx</font>

385
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:10,010
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Ikuta seems to be able to pull this off</font>

386
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:11,090
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Lets take a look, here</font>

387
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:22,430
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Whats the blobby thing at the bottom?!</font>

388
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:24,790
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">I wonder whats that disgusting thing</font>

389
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:26,710
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">What the hell is this!</font>

390
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:31,070
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">I thought my drawing was good so I added the legs below</font>

391
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:33,360
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Ughhh .. this is disgusting!!</font>

392
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,960
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">This Sphinx looks like it could walk at a very fast speed!</font>

393
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:42,120
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">It seems like this Sphinx has traveled from that distant pyramid in the picture</font>

394
00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:47,600
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">But this picture is still considered acceptable</font>

395
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,650
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">EHHH?!</font>

396
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:50,600
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Lets take a look at Eto's picture</font>

397
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:51,640
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Here it is!</font>

398
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:57,000
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">This is the Merlion right!?</font>

399
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,640
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">The Sphinx went to Singapore!</font>

400
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:01,550
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Its the Merlion right?</font>

401
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:03,960
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">I thought the Merlion was the Sphinx</font>

402
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,290
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">-I thought it was something of that structure 
 -But you know what a pyramid is</font>

403
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:10,350
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">I know that the Sphinx is from Egypt</font>

404
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:14,530
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Still .. But still this can be considered as the Sphinx</font>

405
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:17,960
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Nononono, its completely out!</font>

406
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:21,100
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Next, Shiraishi's Sphinx is this!</font>

407
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,110
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">What what what is this?!</font>

408
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:28,790
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">What is this!?</font>

409
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:30,890
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">This looks like the ghost of Nami Hie</font>

410
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:32,000
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">What is this!</font>

411
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:32,900
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Its a ghost ~</font>

412
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,160
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">What is its state of position?</font>

413
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,800
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">This position</font>

414
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,800
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Its turned around with its back facing the front?</font>

415
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,430
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Even the eyes are totally white, what does it stand for?</font>

416
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:42,870
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Because I was in a rush</font>

417
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:43,830
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">In a rush?</font>

418
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:46,010
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Its unfair for you to say that!</font>

419
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:49,990
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Its unfair to say that! You shouldn't be rushing!</font>

420
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,500
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Rushing through a test?</font>

421
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,520
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Theres no such thing as that</font>

422
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,070
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Only you took a long time to complete the test?</font>

423
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:03,040
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">This design can also be turned into a T-Shirt</font>

424
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:06,600
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">But .. this is still considered good</font>

425
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:10,470
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Nonono, it can't be!</font>

426
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:11,560
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Wada Maaya</font>

427
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:16,300
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Lets look at Wada Maaya's picture</font>

428
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:17,040
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">You're kidding me</font>

429
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,870
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">The Sphinx, here it is</font>

430
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,850
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">What the hell is this?!</font>

431
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:27,200
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">You crossed the border! WOAHHH!</font>

432
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,300
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">You totally ditched the topic</font>

433
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:29,500
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">You ditched the topic totally</font>

434
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:32,800
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">This isn't like those history observers studying about the Sphinx right?</font>

435
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,420
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">This is supposed to be the Sphinx right?</font>

436
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:36,220
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">This is Sphinx's older brother perhaps?</font>

437
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:37,660
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">You did a good job looking at it</font>

438
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:43,070
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Look at the bottom part of this picture of the "Sphinx"</font>

439
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:45,220
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">This person is reading a book</font>

440
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:50,860
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Neapolitan is written on the cover of the book 
 Carbonara is also written on the cover</font>

441
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:55,290
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">This person looks like he's really studying about pasta</font>

442
00:20:55,290 --> 00:20:59,310
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">But the book's title is "Sphinx"</font>

443
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,750
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Is the book about Sphinx or what?!</font>

444
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:04,330
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">What is this about? I really want to hear what is this all about</font>

445
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:06,960
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">What is this? Does this persons have any relations to pasta?</font>

446
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,320
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">He is the person who created pasta</font>

447
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:11,430
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">The person who created pasta, Sphinx-san?</font>

448
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:12,880
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">This is amazing ..</font>

449
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,410
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Interesting drawing right?</font>

450
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:19,040
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">I would love it if everyone's drawings were turned into an animation</font>

451
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:21,480
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Ahh that? We didn't do that!</font>

452
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,190
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Perhaps I said too much?</font>

453
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:25,650
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Sugiyama</font>

454
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:33,870
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Next topic is an ideal pet to have</font>

455
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:38,310
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">The members think of a pet they wish to keep and express it in through a drawing</font>

456
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:41,900
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">For this topic, we will also start off with Nishino</font>

457
00:21:42,290 --> 00:21:45,360
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Nishino's ideal pet, here!</font>

458
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:50,180
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Wow .. amazing!</font>

459
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:52,660
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Seriously you're good at this!</font>

460
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:55,200
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">It looks like its actually moving</font>

461
00:21:55,200 --> 00:22:00,890
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">What is this? There are some petals swirling around it</font>

462
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:04,530
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">When you go near it, it would emit a nice smell</font>

463
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:05,600
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Ahh I get it ..</font>

464
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,460
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">This pet is not a dog or something similar to it?</font>

465
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:09,520
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Its closer to a deer or something like that?</font>

466
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,000
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Yes</font>

467
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:16,430
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">In the future, I'm not sure what but when Nogizaka46 is having live tours, you could design the tour T-Shirts</font>

468
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:19,760
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Do it, you have the talent for it</font>

469
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:20,700
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Wada</font>

470
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:22,340
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Woah, erm .. is this Hirano Remi!?</font>

471
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:25,910
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="38"><b>{\an8}Hirano Remi is an actress</b></font>

472
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:29,770
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Ahh! This looks like Hirano Remi!</font>

473
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:32,640
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Its this small</font>

474
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,090
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Oh, this pet is miniature in size</font>

475
00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:35,890
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">What is its size? Around 10cm?</font>

476
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,190
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Its 5cm tall</font>

477
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:39,120
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Ohh, how does its voice sound like?</font>

478
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,400
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Its voice is very low pitched</font>

479
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,090
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Low?! Shouldn't its voice be high pitched instead?</font>

480
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:44,180
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">It seems like it would have a high pitched voice</font>

481
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:45,880
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">The topmost button seems like its ..</font>

482
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:49,150
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">The topmost button is attached onto its skin</font>

483
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,060
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Ehhh 8metres tall!?</font>

484
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:57,830
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Right after this, a shocking piece of work makes its appearance!?</font>

485
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,600
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Theres still more</font>

486
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,230
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">EHHH!?</font>

487
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:02,300
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Takayama's drawing, here it is</font>

488
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:09,800
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">This doesn't come through ..</font>

489
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,570
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Its 8 metres!?</font>

490
00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:13,410
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">EHHH 8 METRES!?</font>

491
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:16,560
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">I really wanted to keep a toy poodle, but</font>

492
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:19,060
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">I now live at my hometown</font>

493
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:22,850
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Its quite tedious traveling to Tokyo</font>

494
00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:26,090
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">I wanted a vehicle for traveling so I mixed them together</font>

495
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:27,680
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">You will ride this 8m toy poodle to work?</font>

496
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:29,840
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Yes, I'll come to work in this</font>

497
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:32,400
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Is the current color of its fur okay?</font>

498
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,090
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Yes, something blueish</font>

499
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:37,270
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Something blueish ~</font>

500
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:39,600
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Last up, Hashimoto!</font>

501
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,410
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">-Well, she should not disappoint us here 
 -You are from an arts university after all</font>

502
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:50,380
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Right after this, finally the unveiling of art student Hashimoto's atrocious pet!?</font>

503
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:53,190
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Last up, Hashimoto</font>

504
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:55,840
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">-Well, she should not disappoint us here 
 -You are from an arts university after all</font>

505
00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:01,010
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Here it is</font>

506
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:04,650
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">What is this? Do you want an old man that looks like that?</font>

507
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:05,990
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">No, its size is miniature</font>

508
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:07,220
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Ahh, the size is miniature right?</font>

509
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,080
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Would it be able to talk?</font>

510
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,900
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">It would just stay in one corner</font>

511
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:13,870
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Its a pet that would just do its own thing without talking?</font>

512
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:17,060
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">It already looks like that ..</font>

513
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:24,730
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">In the next episode, the events that unfolded at Nogizaka's Meet-And-Greet Session would be revealed!</font>

514
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:31,940
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">We are Nogizaka46! Have you already checked our official website?</font>

515
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:37,780
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">The profiles are of course, about member's this-and-that, a variety of information are up!!</font>
