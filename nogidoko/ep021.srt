<font face="Times New Roman" size="32">{\an8}Famous comedian and MC. <s>Member of Katakana Keyakizaka46</s></font>

13
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,860
<font size="38">Tsuchi*(Tsuchida-san).</font>

14
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:31,320
<font size="38">Here are Nogizaka46's members for today.</font>

15
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:37,180
<font size="38">Yayaya...It's really spectacular.</font>

16
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:38,860
<font size="38">Is this everyone? -Yes, everyone.</font>

17
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:41,600
<font size="38">Tsuchi, what do you think? Know any of them?</font>

18
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:45,180
<font size="38">I know they existed. Lately, I kept seeing them on TV.</font>

19
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:50,280
<font size="38">The song with the AKB48's lyrics, and the same location etc.</font>

20
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:53,560
<font size="38">But the melody sounded different.</font>

21
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:57,120
<font size="38">Aki-P really knows what he was doing eh!</font>

22
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,240
<font size="38">So, Himura-san...</font>

23
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:02,960
<font size="38">What's the plan for today's show?
Please read it with an energetic sound.</font>

24
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:10,100
<font size="38">Revealing the true Shichifukujin! Nogizaka46's psychological test!</font>

25
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:16,340
<font size="38">Today, we invited psychology expert Takashi Tomita-sensei.</font>

26
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:21,160
<font size="38">He'll take a look at Shichifukujin's psychological conditions!</font>

27
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,280
<font size="38">So let us do this.</font>

28
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,020
<font size="38">The question is...</font>

29
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:35,880
<font size="38">Use these four different shapes to draw anything you want, you can reuse the same shapes again.</font>

30
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:40,420
<font size="38">The square means group(Nogizaka46). The circle means oneself.</font>

31
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:44,660
<font size="38">The triangle shape means the male.
The downward triangle shape means the female.</font>

32
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:50,840
<font size="38">They'll have different meanings when appeared on different drawings.</font>

33
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:58,480
<font size="38">Because Ikuta, one of the Shichifukujin has to take an exam she'll be absent.</font>

34
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:03,580
<font size="38">Firstly, let's check out Hashimoto's psychological condition.</font>

35
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:03,580
<font size="38">The circle rolled away from the structures, right?</font>

36
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:07,400
<font face="Times New Roman" size="32">{\an8}(Subber: Hashimoto, are you taking a physic test?)</font>

37
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:11,340
<font size="38">-The circle means herself. -She rolled away.</font>

38
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:15,980
<font size="38">Probably because she's still not fully adapted to Nogizaka46 yet.</font>

39
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:19,500
<font size="38">But I'm working really hard to adapt it.</font>

40
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,580
<font size="38">What do you mean "working really hard..."</font>

41
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:26,780
<font size="38">It kinda sounds like "It's impossible..."</font>

42
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:29,620
<font size="38">So, Hashimoto, you think it's impossible right?</font>

43
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:30,860
<font size="38">...No</font>

44
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:33,860
<font size="38">Did she just admit tacitly?</font>

45
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,900
<font size="38">I'm ok with the group, right?</font>

46
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:38,560
<font size="38">Just tell us the truth alright?</font>

47
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:46,540
<font size="38">Earlier today we actually gave the others a secret questionnaire to investigate about the Shichifukujin.</font>

48
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:48,160
<font size="38">-Iwase? -Hai!</font>

49
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,860
<font size="38">For Nanamin, she didn't reply back to members' messages very often.</font>

50
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:58,060
<font size="38">So did something happened privately?</font>

51
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:03,280
<font size="38">When Nanamin was sick, I was worried so I sent a message to her.</font>

52
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:07,940
<font size="38">"Are you ok? Don't force yourself too much." Messages like this.</font>

53
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:10,280
<font size="38">But I never received a reply back.</font>

54
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,220
<font size="38">Eh? Didn't reply?</font>

55
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:16,240
<font size="38">Yeah...I want to be alone at that moment.</font>

56
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,680
<font size="38">Ikr, I totally understood.</font>

57
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,240
<font size="38">Sensei, the problem kinda appeared.</font>

58
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,420
<font size="38">Yes, because the circle rolled very far away.</font>

59
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:28,920
<font size="38">-I see. -She's kinda far from everyone.</font>

60
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:34,820
<font size="38">I often saw Nanami alone during our break time, she kept practicing her funny faces in front of a mirror.</font>

61
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:38,200
<font size="38">So everyone was like "Is she ok?"</font>

62
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,180
<font size="38">What happened here?</font>

63
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:43,720
<font size="38">She probably wanted to control herself.</font>

64
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:48,500
<font size="38">She wants to control herself by doing funny faces in front of a mirror!?</font>

65
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,500
<font size="38">What kind of practice did you do?</font>

66
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:54,680
<font size="38">I'll just look at my own face in front of a mirror,</font>

67
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:59,120
<font size="38">and I'll be disgusted by it because I had no confidence.</font>

68
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,440
<font size="38">You had no confidence in how you look? -No.</font>

69
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,620
<font size="38">Look over here. A bunch of weirdos.</font>

70
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:08,080
<font size="38">Himura-san's gonna commit suicide if that's the case.</font>

71
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,440
<font size="38">I don't even think my face's THAT weird.</font>

72
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:15,520
<font size="38">He even wore a sunglasses at overseas.</font>

73
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:19,500
<font size="38">Next up, Ikoma's psychological analysis!</font>

74
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,440
<font size="38">Wow...it's completely different.</font>

75
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,420
<font size="38">What is that?</font>

76
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:27,020
<font size="38">Only criminals would draw something like this, right?</font>

77
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:35,880
<font size="38">The obvious one was the huge self-consciousness covering almost everything.</font>

78
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:40,780
<font size="38">-Ah, the circle represented herself. 
-Yes, whether male, female or the group.</font>

79
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:43,860
<font size="38">there's a feeling of "I can do everything all alone."</font>

80
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:47,840
<font size="38">She's wanted everything to be under her control.</font>

81
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:52,480
<font size="38">She doesn't have that kind of aura yet. So are you slowly cultivating your confidence?</font>

82
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:53,280
<font size="38">Nope.</font>

83
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,600
<font size="38">This is the result, it's accurate.</font>

84
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:00,560
<font size="38">It came out, alright? Your deep psychological condition came out.</font>

85
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:06,940
<font size="38">She's good at dancing but she wanted to teach us even thou that she did not pay attention(to the class.)</font>

86
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:11,580
<font size="38">That's one heavy burn.</font>

87
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,560
<font size="38">You taught them because you're really confident, right?</font>

88
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,860
<font size="38">I never taught them anything!</font>

89
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:25,120
<font size="38">Memory loss?</font>

90
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,160
<font size="38">But I'm sorry.</font>

91
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:32,120
<font size="38">Yabai...you good?</font>

92
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,220
<font size="38">Well, that's ok too.</font>

93
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,820
<font size="38">It's a good thing that you have confidence.</font>

94
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,180
<font size="38">-A good thing? -Yes.</font>

95
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:44,180
<font size="38">Well, that's fine.</font>

96
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:48,680
<font size="38">Next up, Matsumura's psychological analysis!</font>

97
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:52,560
<font size="38">-She drew a lot of stuff. -Indeed there's a lot going on.</font>

98
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,400
<font size="38">There's a dog. What are those at the above?</font>

99
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,680
<font size="38">Dog?</font>

100
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:55,840
<font size="38">Is that oden*? Looks like oden?</font>

101
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,440
<font face="Times New Roman" size="32">{\an8}A Japanese one-pot winter dish consisting of several ingredients in a light, soy-flavored dashi broth.</font>

102
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,480
<font size="38">Oden*?</font>

103
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,260
<font size="38">Did you draw the dog first?</font>

104
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:02,020
<font size="38">I drew these first.</font>

105
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:04,840
<font size="38">Ah, you drew those first?</font>

106
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,620
<font size="38">So what's next?</font>

107
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:08,340
<font size="38">The next one was the dog.</font>

108
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:10,340
<font size="38">But why did you draw an oden?</font>

109
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:12,500
<font size="38">Because there were spaces left,</font>

110
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:15,380
<font size="38">and I haven't use the square shape.</font>

111
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:18,540
<font size="38">Ain't that a square on the dog's body?</font>

112
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:23,860
<font size="38">If you really cared about the empty spaces, why there's nothing at the bottom.</font>

113
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:31,880
<font size="38">-So what's your opinion sensei?
-The dog's circle head represented herself,</font>

114
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:34,840
<font size="38">and she drew the circle above "the group"(square.)</font>

115
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:38,500
<font size="38">So you think the group is like a dog?</font>

116
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:48,580
<font size="38">Probably her existence was like a leader in the group.</font>

117
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:54,080
<font size="38">But take a look at the above, she drew three triangles.</font>

118
00:09:54,080 --> 00:10:00,800
<font size="38">She's attracted to the opposite sex.</font>

119
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:05,660
<font size="38">Because there are two circles between the triangles, right?</font>

120
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:08,580
<font size="38">She even drew those first.</font>

121
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:13,280
<font size="38">Actually, she's not that attracted to the male,</font>

122
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,320
<font size="38">she just love to eat.</font>

123
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:18,400
<font size="38">Yes, it's really weird.</font>

124
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:24,000
<font size="38">This morning she ate ten pancakes.</font>

125
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,620
<font size="38">Eh, no...I only ate the small pancakes.</font>

126
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,680
<font size="38">It's true! I'm telling the truth!</font>

127
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:36,460
<font size="38">-What da hell are u talking about? -The hell you talking about?</font>

128
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:41,340
<font size="38">You should be careful...eating that much.</font>

129
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:43,340
<font size="38">Yes, I really agree.</font>

130
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:45,460
<font size="38">Yeah like what if you become fat.</font>

131
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:50,100
<font size="38">But if there's a fat member in the group wouldn't it be more interesting?</font>

132
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,700
<font size="38">Yeah, it's kinda cute.</font>

133
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:55,320
<font size="38">There's a KPOP group called Super Junior, right?</font>

134
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:55,320
<font size="38">There's one fat person in the group,</font>

135
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,740
<font face="Times New Roman" size="32">{\an8}(Subber: Shots fired. RIP Shindong.)</font>

136
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:00,260
<font size="38">and he's kinda dazzling too.</font>

137
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:03,580
<font size="38">Well, it kinda works, no?</font>

138
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:06,400
<font size="38">But there's none in Japanese groups.</font>

139
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,500
<font size="38">That's because they were all fired.</font>

140
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:14,500
<font size="38">What kind of deep psychological condition does the 14 years old Hoshino have?</font>

141
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:17,800
<font size="38">She drew a house.</font>

142
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:22,580
<font size="38">The group and herself are far apart from each other.</font>

143
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:26,360
<font size="38">It's like she is cynical and has no interest in other stuff.</font>

144
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:30,900
<font size="38">There are a few sentences Minami like to say</font>

145
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:37,020
<font size="38">"I'mma sleep," and "I'm hungry." She always said those two sentences.</font>

146
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:41,840
<font size="38">-Well, even you guys said that right?
-Nope. Not even once. Minami's the one that said those sentences.</font>

147
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:45,640
<font size="38">-You guys too. -No, we did not.</font>

148
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:53,060
<font size="38">Minami's not interested in other stuff except foods and her hair bangs.</font>

149
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:56,360
<font size="38">She called me very often, "If you're free..."</font>

150
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:59,620
<font size="38">"let's go to the Mcdonald's and eat some fries, Maya."</font>

151
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:02,620
<font size="38">Isn't that another meaning for "Ya better buy me some fries!"</font>

152
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:08,700
<font size="38">"Ya better go and get me some bread and snacks!"</font>

153
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:13,420
<font size="38">But the fact that she's interested in her hair bangs, it's kinda mature.</font>

154
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:17,600
<font size="38">Yes, she's afraid that people will discuss her hairs if her hairs' not cute enough.</font>

155
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,380
<font size="38">Just like NON STYLE's Inoue-san?</font>

156
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:23,100
<font size="38">His hair bangs are really smooth and tidy.</font>

157
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:27,360
<font size="38">Next up, Shiraishi's unexpected psychological condition!?</font>

158
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,360
<font size="38">What the hell are those?</font>

159
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,360
<font size="38">What the...</font>

160
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:37,380
<font size="38">A stack of triangles covered by a lot of circles.</font>

161
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:41,120
<font size="38">There's a cube on the right too.</font>

162
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,700
<font size="38">That's a box.</font>

163
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:47,380
<font size="38">Are we not usually draw stuff in the middle first when we get the paper?</font>

164
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:55,220
<font size="38">This drawing was split into two parts. -Ah, you guys noticed that.</font>

165
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:59,440
<font size="38">The drawing was perfectly split two parts.</font>

166
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,740
<font size="38">The left represented both genders and herself.</font>

167
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:07,360
<font size="38">The right represented her job and the group.</font>

168
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:11,460
<font size="38">-She separated them completely from each other. -Oh! Sugoi!</font>

169
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:14,440
<font size="38">So her working(public) and her private life were completely separated.</font>

170
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,160
<font size="38">So she's that kind of person.</font>

171
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:22,120
<font size="38">For Maiyan, she was very loud on the bus.</font>

172
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:26,860
<font size="38">So she was very bothersome when we're on the bus.</font>

173
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:31,180
<font size="38">She was excited.</font>

174
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:35,680
<font size="38">But she's very calm in front of the staffs.</font>

175
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:44,400
<font size="38">She totally separates her public and private life.</font>

176
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:49,060
<font size="38">So works are works and vice versa. Her mood switched between these two.</font>

177
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:51,680
<font size="38">So do you get excited when you were working?</font>

178
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,680
<font size="38">Yes, something like that.</font>

179
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:58,560
<font size="38">Next up, Takayama's deep psychological analysis.</font>

180
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,560
<font size="38">Eh? An elevator?</font>

181
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:06,780
<font size="38">Ummm...does the triangle buttons or what have some different meanings?</font>

182
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:13,700
<font size="38">I thought that it'll be better if I drew them.</font>

183
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:19,400
<font face="Times New Roman" size="32">{\an8}Playing <i>Takayama-mopping-windows.mp3</i></font>

184
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:24,640
<font size="38">The elevator, do you want to go up or down?</font>

185
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:28,560
<font size="38">Ummm...Up? Going up.</font>

186
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,140
<font size="38">Well, the circle obviously represented herself.</font>

187
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:34,680
<font size="38">This might represent her future career's path?</font>

188
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:37,440
<font size="38">You went right into your own career(elevator.)</font>

189
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,520
<font size="38">So there's that big rectangle, right?</font>

190
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:46,200
<font size="38">That's probably the fate of Nogizaka46.</font>

191
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:49,360
<font size="38">When you open the door you can discover more interesting things.</font>

192
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,840
<font size="38">Which means she can travel to different places,</font>

193
00:14:52,740 --> 00:15:03,020
<font size="38">and she will have more possibilities in her life.</font>

194
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:05,400
<font size="38">So you thought Nogizaka46's your everything.</font>

195
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,160
<font size="38">Yes, for now, I really thought Nogiz...</font>

196
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,360
<font size="38">You just said "For now" right?</font>

197
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,900
<font size="38">-No no no no... -Does this mean after a few years...</font>

198
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:16,620
<font size="38">you'll probably hop to other company? -No. It's not like this.</font>

199
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:19,920
<font face="Times New Roman" size="32">{\an8}I stayed at Kazumi's house before...</font>

200
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,480
<font size="38">Kawai. Staying at friends' house etc. -Not bad, there's that right.</font>

201
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:26,960
<font size="38">Tsuchida over here invited me to do that yesterday.</font>

202
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,740
<font size="38">Because I worked until 2 AM yesterday,</font>

203
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:35,840
<font size="38">and I complained because this studio was far away from my house.</font>

204
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:38,740
<font size="38">"Well, stay at my house." This guy said.</font>

205
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:41,360
<font size="38">If you're 20 years old or what that's totally fine.</font>

206
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:42,500
<font size="38">But you know...</font>

207
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:47,360
<font size="38">Two old men that's over 40 years old, the hell were you thinking!?</font>

208
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,900
<font size="38">We won't say "Ayyy, come and stay at my house after tomorrow's works!"</font>

209
00:15:54,960 --> 00:16:00,900
<font size="38">Ah! So after that, Kazumi told me that she always wanted to be a nurse.</font>

210
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:03,760
<font size="38">-Do you want to be a nurse? -Yes.</font>

211
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:09,660
<font size="38">But she said that since she's already in Nogizaka46, she'll do her best in Nogizaka46.</font>

212
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:13,200
<font size="38">So I thought she's cool since she's fully focused on Nogizaka46.</font>

213
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:16,280
<font size="38">Say, what do you wear when you were sleeping?</font>

214
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:20,540
<font size="38">What a "good" topic.</font>

215
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:24,060
<font size="38">She wore thin green pajamas, right?</font>

216
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:28,620
<font size="38">-No idea. -It's impossible for us to know.</font>

217
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:32,060
<font size="38">Not the colors, this guy asked about what did you wore.</font>

218
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:35,260
<font size="38">I'm asking about the materials of the pajamas.</font>

219
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:36,380
<font size="38">Those warm type.</font>

220
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:40,680
<font size="38">-Fluffy? with green color? -Yes.</font>

221
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,660
<font size="38">Takayama, you too?</font>

222
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:44,660
<font size="38">Ah! I wore a thin green and blue co-</font>

223
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:46,900
<font size="60">ENOUGH WITH THE COLORS!</font>

224
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:49,740
<font size="38">-Enough! -These kids had no idea what the old man asked.</font>

225
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:51,520
<font size="38">I know you all wore a thin green pajama.</font>

226
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:58,820
<font size="38">Next up, the reveal of the type of men that these girls' desired unconsciously.</font>

227
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:01,960
<font size="38">Our next test is going to be...</font>

228
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,660
<font size="38">"You got your driving license recently and can't wait to go out,</font>

229
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:09,120
<font size="38">but you had an accident at the junction,</font>

230
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:14,920
<font size="38">what kind of car did you crash into? Please draw it out."</font>

231
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:18,900
<font size="38">First up, the car that Ikoma crashed into.</font>

232
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:19,700
<font size="38">Eh? 夜露死苦*(Yoroshiku)?</font>

233
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:23,240
<font face="Times New Roman" size="32">{\an8}The act of assigning kanjis to words that ignore kanji's meaning is called 当て字(ateji). 夜露死苦(Yoroshiku) is an "ateji" more unique to the biker gangs culture of Japan.</font>

234
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:23,240
<font size="38">Is that like a yanki's* car?</font>

235
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:27,380
<font face="Times New Roman" size="32">{\an8}A yanki was basically the subgroup for delinquent students. "Bosozoku" a.k.a. biker gangs had a similar style to yanki, but were known for their outrageous and illegally modified motorcycles.</font>

236
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,040
<font size="38">It's really bad if you really hit it.</font>

237
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:29,060
<font size="38">If you hit this car on a junction you're dead.</font>

238
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:32,720
<font face="Times New Roman" size="32">{\an8}(Subber: *cough* Majisuka *cough* Gakuen *cough*)</font>

239
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:37,300
<font size="38">They probably all have weapons with them.</font>

240
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:40,460
<font size="38">You will get beaten up really bad like you're in hell.</font>

241
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:43,300
<font size="38">What's the deal with this, sensei?</font>

242
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:50,340
<font size="38">So the drawing represents the kind of men the girls will attract without knowing.</font>

243
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:54,020
<font size="38">So Ikoma might attract delinquents?</font>

244
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:57,300
<font size="38">Probably someone like Masahiro Chono*? Those kinds of dangerous looking people.</font>

245
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:01,960
<font face="Times New Roman" size="32">{\an8}(A semi-retired American-born Japanese professional wrestler.)</font>

246
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:01,960
<font size="38">Wait, wait...that's Keiji Mutoh*.</font>

247
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:04,760
<font face="Times New Roman" size="32">{\an8}(a Japanese professional wrestler.)</font>

248
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,760
<font size="38">Sorry I got the wrong person.</font>

249
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:10,680
<font size="38">Which of them do you prefer?</font>

250
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:15,160
<font size="38">Wait...she's going to pick one from these hellish people?</font>

251
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:18,040
<font size="38">There's no idols or superstars over here.</font>

252
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:20,740
<font size="38">But I kinda like men with fluffy hair.</font>

253
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:22,580
<font size="38">That's why these two...</font>

254
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:28,580
<font size="38">It's just simply because she really hate you. -No, it's not like that!</font>

255
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:31,880
<font size="38">But I really like you, Ikoma.</font>

256
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:37,020
<font size="38">Next up, Hashimoto's car.</font>

257
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,200
<font size="38">Ummm which one is your car?</font>

258
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,200
<font size="38">Ah, they're the same car.</font>

259
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,420
<font size="38">Ah, so it's from a front and a side view.</font>

260
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:45,400
<font size="38">Just like an automobile catalog.</font>

261
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:48,660
<font size="38">-Yeah! -They have a front and a side view of a car.</font>

262
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:56,180
<font size="38">If it's a compact car, it means those who are younger than her.</font>

263
00:18:56,180 --> 00:19:02,020
<font size="38">the other person is not that strong,</font>

264
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:07,340
<font size="38">But the car on the left is more bigger.</font>

265
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:09,800
<font size="38">Yeah, a big compact car.</font>

266
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:15,100
<font size="38">Just like a giant baby.</font>

267
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:19,680
<font size="38">Is it for those who are really short, but wanted a higher car seat?</font>

268
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,660
<font size="38">What a weird balance.</font>

269
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,660
<font size="38">That kid's really sick.</font>

270
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:30,640
<font size="38">Next up, a weird car that was drawn by Shiraishi.</font>

271
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:33,480
<font size="38">What kind of car is that?</font>

272
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:36,100
<font size="38">Why's the rear side curved like that?</font>

273
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:41,520
<font size="38">Because I hit a really fast car, like those convertible cars.</font>

274
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,040
<font size="38">The hell is a convertible look like this!?</font>

275
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:47,420
<font size="38">Well I mean, it's from your imagination.</font>

276
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:51,860
<font size="38">By the first look, I thought you might attract someone who's really weird.</font>

277
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:54,420
<font size="38">But after listening to your reason why, I think it's fine.</font>

278
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:58,260
<font size="38">There's no such car like this, right?</font>

279
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:02,760
<font size="38">Probably because the rear side of it's really weird.</font>

280
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:05,380
<font size="38">Because cars don't look like that.</font>

281
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:07,880
<font size="38">I relieved after hearing your explanations.</font>

282
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:07,880
<font size="38">You better draw it better next time,
it looks like Suneo Honekawa*'s hair.</font>

283
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:12,280
<font face="Times New Roman" size="32">{\an8}Dat fox-faced rich kid from Doraemon.</font>

284
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,240
<font size="38">Maybe she likes Suneo?</font>

285
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:20,840
<font size="38">By the way, Takayama drew an expensive car so she will probably meet a rich person.</font>

286
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:26,080
<font size="38">Hoshino who drew a four-door family car will attract fatherly-figures.</font>

287
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:31,280
<font size="38">Matsumura who drew a taxi might meet someone that's hardworking.</font>

288
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:37,580
<font size="38">Next up, the member that nobody wanted to be friend with?</font>

289
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,140
<font size="38">The next question is going to be...</font>

290
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:52,940
<font face="Times New Roman" size="30">"You're going to send one member to the space to have a location shooting in a rocket."</font>

291
00:20:52,940 --> 00:21:00,040
<font face="Times New Roman" size="30">"-Who's going to be in the rocket?" So which member will be most likely to be sent? -Ah, I got it.</font>

292
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:07,640
<font size="38">Who's the popular member here?</font>

293
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,480
<font size="38">Hashimoto!</font>

294
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:12,960
<font size="38">-Ah I know right. -Yes. I know right!</font>

295
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,140
<font size="38">"Ikr...Ikr..." They even clapped their hands.</font>

296
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:18,200
<font size="38">What's the meaning of this, sensei?</font>

297
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,920
<font size="38">Going into space, a far place.</font>

298
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:26,840
<font size="38">So going somewhere that far means you won't be seeing that person for a long time.
It means they don't want to see her.</font>

299
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:31,520
<font size="38">Well, you guys even clapped for a while.</font>

300
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:36,160
<font size="38">Its too late to apologize, alright.</font>

301
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:39,860
<font size="38">Saying "No, it's wrong." It's obviously a lie.</font>

302
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:46,240
<font size="38">It's not that they hate her, it's like "if that person did not do it, I'll be forced to do it."</font>

303
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:49,460
<font size="38">Like a rival?</font>

304
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:53,580
<font size="38">Those who picked Hashimoto, please raise your hand. There are 7 members.</font>

305
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:58,180
<font size="38">Alright, Hashimoto, remember them so you can have your revenge later.</font>

306
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:01,160
<font size="38">The space suit really fits Hashimoto.</font>

307
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:03,160
<font size="38">Do you think we're stupid?</font>

308
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:08,140
<font size="38">Who would be happy if someone says "the space suit fit you."</font>

309
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:12,780
<font size="38">She often said that she liked to be alone, so I thought why not give her a chance.</font>

310
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:14,940
<font size="38">The studio will probably become like "Suzuran High School*."</font>

311
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:18,740
<font face="Times New Roman" size="32">{\an8}From the manga series "Crows Zero,"Suzuran All-Boys High School", an institution infamous for its population of violent delinquents.</font>

312
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:25,200
<font size="38">-No, it's not like that. -You all kept saying no, but this is your true psychology.</font>

313
00:22:26,360 --> 00:24:15,020
<font size="38">Next up, they're going to perform "Nogizaka no Uta" in front of the crowd.</font>

314
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:19,300
<font size="38">Next up, they're going to learn how to do Oogiri!</font>
