20
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:15,950
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">What do you think?</font>

21
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:19,850

 What are you going to perform?</font>

35
00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:01,040
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">We will do a Magic Show</font>

36
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,190
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Magic Show? 
 You'll do that?</font>

37
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:07,220
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">On the other side, what will Team White perform first?</font>

38
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:09,690
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Chinese Spinning Top</font>

39
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:11,880
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Wah, Chinese Spinning Top, huh</font>

40
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:13,340
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Is it something like this?</font>

41
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:16,530
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">It looks difficult 
 Yes, it's really difficult</font>

42
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:20,730
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">So, for first round, Magic Show from Red Team</font>

43
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:27,790
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Red Team's starter, include these four, who in the beginning couldn't even open the box of cards</font>

44
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:34,500
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">With no member that is skillful, they have been training hard under the instructor</font>

45
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:40,460
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">There's no room for mistakes 
 Let the magic begin.</font>

46
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:44,120
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Ready, go 
 It's Showtime</font>

47
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:48,720
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Okay...</font>

48
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:54,030
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">First, here I have some unfolded trump card boxes</font>

49
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:55,830
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">One, two, and three</font>

50
00:02:56,260 --> 00:03:00,050
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">I'll fold this box to its real shape</font>

51
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:04,510
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">As you see, there's nothing inside hence it won't produce any sound</font>

52
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:06,370
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">But, when I cast a spell on it</font>

53
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:07,650
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Huh?</font>

54
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:10,570
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">From the inside, there is a Trump Card</font>

55
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:13,820
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Next, Ikoma-san, please</font>

56
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:14,630
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Okay...</font>

57
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:20,310
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">So, I'm going to shuffle the cards that I received from Hori-chan</font>

58
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:24,230
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">I'll do the shuffle normally</font>

59
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:27,100
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Try to imagine the usual me</font>

60
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:30,310
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Bad at Sports, 
 Clumsy</font>

61
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,110
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">But, I'm...</font>

62
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:33,820
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">You are very clumsy</font>

63
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:36,030
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">I am, yes.</font>

64
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:37,730
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">I'll do this</font>

65
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:39,060
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Wah, that's good</font>

66
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:45,760
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">As I'm done shuffling, I will spread the cards</font>

67
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,760
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">They have spread nicely</font>

68
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,300
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Eh, you're good</font>

69
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:52,470
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">One more trick</font>

70
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:59,590
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">If I spread it in a straight line, it will do as I say</font>

71
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:02,000
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Ha ha ha, wow, that's neat</font>

72
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:08,270
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">But, the real magic starts now</font>

73
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:11,170
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">So, what should I do?</font>

74
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:13,490
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">She's is facing backwards</font>

75
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:16,060
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Ah, Himura-san.</font>

76
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:20,030
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Pick what you like from these cards</font>

77
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:20,760
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Point it with my finger?</font>

78
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,250
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Yes, any card will do</font>

79
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:23,790
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Which one did you choose?</font>

80
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:26,230
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Ah, I pick this
 -This card? 
 -Yes</font>

81
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:28,700
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">The card that you picked is this</font>

82
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,320
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Is that OK? 
 -Yes</font>

83
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,450
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Please show this to everyone</font>

84
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:33,570
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">You don't see it?</font>

85
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:35,590
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">I won't look at it</font>

86
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:36,990
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Show it to this camera</font>

87
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:41,550
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">You've remembered it?</font>

88
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,890
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Please, put it back here</font>

89
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:45,290
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">I'll close them</font>

90
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:47,480
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Himura-san please shuffle them</font>

91
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:48,960
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">I'll do it</font>

92
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:49,290
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Yes, please</font>

93
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:53,150
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">He will shuffle them randomly</font>

94
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:56,600
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Shuffle them randomly so I don't know where the card is</font>

95
00:04:56,860 --> 00:05:00,220
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">To avoid suspicion, any of the members can shuffle it too</font>

96
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:05,470
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Shiraishi's shuffling it too</font>

97
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:07,880
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">It's okay this way?</font>

98
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:09,910
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">I'm capable of performing magic.</font>

99
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,470
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">It's absolutely shuffled</font>

100
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:16,700
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">This time, I'll pass it to Manatsu</font>

101
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,780
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Manatsu will do it from now?</font>

102
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:23,090
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">So, for Himura-san's card</font>

103
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,700
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">You're kidding right?</font>

104
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,460
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Haven't we seen this before</font>

105
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:29,910
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">This legendary saber will pick the card</font>

106
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:31,740
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">What kind of legend?</font>

107
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,150
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">This legendary saber is truly sharp</font>

108
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:40,490
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">I'm scared</font>

109
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:43,800
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Eh, why? 
 Is there any magician like that?</font>

110
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:48,200
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Now, I will show what Himura-san's card is</font>

111
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,940
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">For that, Ikoma-chan please</font>

112
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:55,670
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Okay, these card that you all shuffled will be put inside this hat</font>

113
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:00,080
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Now, I have cast the spell</font>

114
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,650
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Oh, legendary saber, please show us Himura-san's card</font>

115
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:06,530
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Wow, they're joking, right</font>

116
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:08,140
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Ah, it got stabbed</font>

117
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:09,430
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">If that is the same card...</font>

118
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:11,100
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">The card that you picked</font>

119
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,430
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Is no doubt an 8 Diamonds, right?</font>

120
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:15,750
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Eeeh, amazing!</font>

121
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:16,890
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Is this right?</font>

122
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:18,800
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Yes!</font>

123
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:22,730
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">It is amazing</font>

124
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,410
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Why did she know it?</font>

125
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:27,270
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Next trick, I will put this card in here</font>

126
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:31,080
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">I will put this card into this wooden box</font>

127
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,470
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">The card is teared apart</font>

128
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:33,280
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">I put it in</font>

129
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:36,440
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Then, zukkyun <font face="Arial"><font color="#ad6eeb">♥ </font></font></font>

130
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:38,930
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">And, the card's gone like this</font>

131
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:42,150
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">It's gone</font>

132
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:46,820
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">And for the missing card,</font>

133
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:48,550
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Minami will show it</font>

134
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:49,490
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Here she is</font>

135
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:51,640
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">What will Hoshino do?</font>

136
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:54,550
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">As you can see, I'm wearing a black t-shirt now</font>

137
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,200
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Manatsu, give me the power</font>

138
00:06:57,490 --> 00:06:58,800
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Zukkyun <font face="Arial"><font color="#ad6eeb">♥ </font></font></font>

139
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,560
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">What was that?</font>

140
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,400
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">From Manatsu's power</font>

141
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:06,850
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">ta-dah!</font>

142
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,540
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Eh, why?</font>

143
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:14,460
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Eight of diamonds card is there</font>

144
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:18,250
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Last, we'll cast another spell</font>

145
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:19,210
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Go!</font>

146
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:21,720
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">What will happen?</font>

147
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,200
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">O,</font>

148
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:24,330

149
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:25,530

150
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:28,600
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Yeah!</font>

151
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,870
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Wow, that's amazing</font>

152
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:38,630
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Somehow, this is quite something
You've been training hard for this?</font>

153
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:40,470
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Yes we have</font>

154
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:42,470
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Is it necessary to train for this?</font>

155
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:45,580
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">I've never succeeded in it before...</font>

156
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:45,890
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Really? You failed at this so many times before?</font>

157
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:47,740
<font size="40"><b>{\an5}The first success</b></font>

158
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:49,370
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Yes, she did</font>

159
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:51,570
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">But this can be considered good, right?</font>

160
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:53,640
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">It's wonderful!</font>

161
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:58,520
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Well, next is the White Team</font>

162
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:02,220
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">First round is Chinese Spinning Top</font>

163
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:09,900
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Be able to spin the top continuously is the basics of everything.
Members have been constantly practicing it.</font>

164
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:13,620
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Furthermore, while incorporating individual techniques,</font>

165
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:19,200
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">they have been under heavy pressure when they practiced combination techniques as there is no room for mistakes.</font>

166
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:22,890
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">These five members put in the most time practicing out of all the teams</font>

167
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:27,780
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Can they show it in a one shot game?</font>

168
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,050
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Start the Music!</font>

169
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:45,090
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Seira, go for it!</font>

170
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:54,780
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Here I go</font>

171
00:09:56,270 --> 00:10:20,960
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Ah, I see...</font>

172
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,350
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Go for it!</font>

173
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:32,840
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Ready, Go!</font>

174
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:42,180
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Crap, it isn't spinning</font>

175
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:44,240
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">It isn't spinning</font>

176
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,300
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Go for it~</font>

177
00:10:56,780 --> 00:11:00,090
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">I did it!</font>

178
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:04,870
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Here, ready, go!</font>

179
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:36,960
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Ready, go!</font>

180
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,710
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Ready, go!</font>

181
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:46,360
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">We did it!</font>

182
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:49,710
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">At the last part, It touched the mic</font>

183
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:51,650
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Well, can't do anything about it</font>

184
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:58,310
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">That's amazing and it looks very difficult but we don't know where's the difficulty</font>

185
00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:00,720
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">The difficult part is getting it to spin</font>

186
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,780
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">I have never done this before</font>

187
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:06,360
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">It's difficult to keep the balance 
 Because Wada can't do it</font>

188
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,360
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">It won't spin</font>

189
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:14,480
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">(Singing something)</font>

190
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:16,820
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">It is difficult</font>

191
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:19,320
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">To even incorporate with techniques, that is not something that can be easily done</font>

192
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,990
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Pass the top to me</font>

193
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:27,820
<font size="40"><b>{\an5}Can't get away the song</b></font>

194
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,160
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Okay, you've all done it</font>

195
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:33,630
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">So now, we want to know the scores</font>

196
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:38,370
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">First, Red Team's Magic Show. How much will they get?</font>

197
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:41,880
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">After this, the scores will be revealed</font>

198
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:47,410
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">First contestant, Red Team's Magic Show, what will their score be?</font>

00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:07,380

203
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:09,760

207
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:24,370
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Ah, it's 46!</font>

208
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:25,660
<font size="40"><b>{\an5}Even when they lose...</b></font>

209
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:28,120
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">46 has come out, eh?</font>

210
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:30,630
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Second round,</font>

211
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:33,160
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Red Team will show?</font>

212
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:36,780
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Ready... go, we'll show Tap Dance</font>

213
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:40,060

215
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:46,810

 - Yes, us two</font>

216
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:48,870
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">What will you show?</font>

217
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:52,810

218
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:57,360
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Okay, let's see Red Team's Tap Dance</font>

219
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:01,600
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">They have been given the choreography from the first day</font>

220
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:06,230
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">They have been constantly practicing it to remember the rhythm</font>

221
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:13,420
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">With Noujou who has experience as the center, a choreography with high level individual techniques is complete</font>

222
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:16,950
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Well then, It's show time!</font>

00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:28,080
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">That's perfect</font>

229
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:31,360
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Noujou, You have some experience in this, don't you?</font>

230
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,430
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Yes, I did this for one year when I was in 3rd grade of elementary</font>

231
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:34,820
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">It's only one year?</font>

232
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:37,990
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">And, for the rest it's first time?</font>

233
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:38,360
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Yes, it is</font>

234
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:41,460
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">This tap dance can't be done in a few weeks</font>

235
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:43,770
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">How much tapping do you do?</font>

236
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:46,930
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">This is two times, and this is one time, right?</font>

237
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:48,360
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Himura-san, can you do it?</font>

238
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:52,090

240
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:57,750
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">But, it's still amazing</font>

241
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:00,960
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">This is hard, for the first timer, you can't really understand it, can you?</font>

242
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:03,600
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">The way to wear this heels is kinda...</font>

243
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,120
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">But those are the usual heels</font>

244
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:05,350
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Those really are</font>

245
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:07,220

248
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:20,180
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">They have to practice to ensure the voice they use with the doll is the same at all times.</font>

249
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:23,230
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">They must talk without moving their lips</font>

250
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:28,110
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">And then, they had a problem with matching the words with dolls</font>

251
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:31,530
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">But, the most difficult problem is the manzai</font>

252
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:36,020
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">This is their problem which is more important than anything else</font>

253
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:41,100

260
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:05,710
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Hey, hey, hey! You forgot one person!</font>

261
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:08,970
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Ah, I kinda forgot you were there since you didn't have any presence!</font>

262
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,230
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">In 2013, a lot of things happened~</font>

268
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:28,230
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">What did you say after you said 'The three of us are'</font>

<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">You extended the introduction! Did you ask for permission to do that?</font>

272
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,220
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">I didn't. I can't do that?</font>

273
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:39,090
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Of course you can't</font>

274
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:40,400
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Change how you say it!</font>

278
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:52,980
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Ah, you're so annoying</font>

279
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:56,250
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">If it's so, let's just call you as a doll</font>

280
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:57,360

281
00:18:57,710 --> 00:19:00,400
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Am I not gonna get any nickname?</font>

282
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:02,400
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">You're lack of affection!</font>

283
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:04,860
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Can I start first?</font>

284
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,020
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Yes, go ahead</font>

285
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:09,940
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Year 2014 is getting close</font>

286
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,720
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Err, but...</font>

<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Yes, there was</font>

289

290
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:20,730
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">That's in 2012</font>

291
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,570
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">For events in 2013, there is that, Kie-chan?</font>

292
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:26,220
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Ah, 'that' is</font>

293
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:30,440
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Je! Je! Je! Je! Je!</font>

294
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,870
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">It's not that!</font>

295
00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:36,330
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">But it can't be helped even if we keep clinging onto things from last year</font>

296
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,460
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Just like new year's day, let's decide this year's goal</font>

297
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:42,200
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Ah, it's true. But normally..</font>

298
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:45,460
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Because I haven't thought about this year's goal, how about making a syllable essay?</font>

299
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:46,920
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Well, Hiroshi..</font>

300
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,450
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Please say a word for the syllable essay</font>

301
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:51,840
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Well, how about 'Nogizaka' at first?</font>

302
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:55,380
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Nogizaka right? I will say Nogizaka's goal, okay..</font>

303
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:58,300
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Well, first is Nanase...</font>

304
00:19:58,770 --> 00:19:59,830
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">And then Sayuri</font>

305
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:02,850
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Me, and the next is Akie. How about that?</font>

306
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:04,850
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Okay, start from me</font>

307
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:05,970

308
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:07,650
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Have a big expectation</font>

309
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:09,230
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Oh, it's true</font>

310
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:10,590
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Then, 'Gi'</font>

311
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:12,500

312
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:13,990
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">That's quite good!</font>

00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:21,940
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">It's too real!</font>

317
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:23,540
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Please say something more Idol-ish</font>

318
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:25,450
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Then, let's go to the next one</font>

319
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:26,690
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">For next,</font>

320
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:30,270
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">let's use Ta-ka-ya-ma (Kazumi), a suitable goal for Kazumin</font>

329
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:44,380

330
00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:49,360
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Then, let's use the word A-Ki-Mo-To (Manatsu), think of a suitable goal for Manatsu-san</font>

331
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:50,960
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">This time, start from Hiroshi</font>

341
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:06,060
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Ah no, let's just leave it aside</font>

342
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,880
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Well, a syllable essay has been done perfectly</font>

354
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:44,860
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">That is something you shouldn't say!</font>

355
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:47,500
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">That's all from us, Fourth Generation J Soul Brothers!</font>

00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:31,090
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">That's right. This is suited for you</font>

387
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,410
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Well, their score is?</font>

388
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:11,660
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Nine, nine, ten, ten, nine.</font>

389
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:13,320
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Total is...</font>

391
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,390
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">It's strict</font>

392
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:23,350
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">From a technique perspective, I think they did great.</font>

393
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:29,890
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Within two weeks, they can do this much already, along with individual techniques. I think it's awesome.</font>

394
00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:31,980
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">It's just that, I can do it too.</font>

395
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:36,180
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">So that's the minus points</font>

396
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:43,060
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Next, the opponent, 
White Team's Ventriloquist Manzai</font>

397
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:44,580

398
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:50,800
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Ten, nine, ten, nine, ten.</font>

399
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:53,270
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Total is...</font>

402
00:23:58,220 --> 00:23:59,650
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">You lose by one point</font>

403
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:04,770
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Frankly speaking, when I heard they will do Manzai, I think we'll win this</font>

404
00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:07,100
