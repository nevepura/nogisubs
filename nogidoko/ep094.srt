The 1st topic is this!

Member who grow up the most is... This is a definite topic,
you people already doing this for more than 1 year.

20
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:02,740
And in this year, the one who make significant grow
and became closer to entertainment and cute, like that.

21
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,740
Firstly, no 3 is this person!

22
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,520
Nishino!

23
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,520
Ah Nishino...

24
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:13,940
Her style is obvious, her personality is also changed, she has grown.

25
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:22,460
I thought she is a delinquent when i saw her at audition,
there's answer like this and we have her photo at audition... THIS!

26
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,940
It's very different.

27
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:30,180
Her face still have a thorn.

28
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:32,940
Yes... This is 2 years ago right...

29
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:36,700
Yes, but it isn't that long ago, only for 2 years, her face is changed.

30
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:42,660
Yes, i agree with you. I think my personality that time is worse than now.

31
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,280
Oh yeah? How is nowadays?

32
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:50,120
Nowadays, my way of thinking is different.

33
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:53,140
Heee, so last time you just kick a wild cat if you found one right...

34
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,760
I didn't but...

35
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:57,380
- You didn't do it?
- She won't do it right.

36
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:01,980
Ok, member who grow up the most no 2 is...

37
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:05,960
Sakurai

38
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:07,900
Her lame style is disappear.

39
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:12,140
So until now, someone think your style is lame.

40
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:14,100
She became more like a girl.

41
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:15,740
I see.

42
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:19,480
There's opinion like that also and we have her photo. HERE!

43
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:25,700
- Wow, she's completely different!
- She's very young.

44
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:32,400
Only in 1-2 years you became a very different person, look at your face, so different!

45
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:35,700
Sakurai at that time, I can't imagine her to do bungee jump.

46
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,760
Even in my dream.

47
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,760
Yes, that girl is a definite change.

48
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,840
So do you feel any differences?

49
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:48,460
Yes, I try to be more girly.

50
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,600
I see.

51
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:54,280
Yes, you are innocent at that time, not even make-up.

52
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,780
I rarely did make-up that time.

53
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:58,040
Ok let's go to no 1.

54
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:58,820
No 1!

55
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:02,540
Member who grow up the most no 1 is this person!

56
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,100
I knew it!

57
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:05,140
Ikoma!

58
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:09,240
Ikoma is more shining now if you compare it with audition time.

59
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,420
I see.

60
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:14,620
She's maturing everyday. And her face is changed better.

61
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:22,120
Her hunchback is cured. And so on. Let us see her photo at that time.

62
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:28,920
She's cute but...

63
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,320
When i went to tokyo 1st time, i don't get the meaning of hunchback.

64
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,540
So you mean that you can't see the person who said that right?

65
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,820
No! I'm not that bad.

66
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:40,040
So you cured it by yourself?

67
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:46,460
Last time, i thought this pose is my natural pose, then...

68
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:50,320
Our staff said that is a hunchback, so i better fix it and they just pushed my back.

69
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,480
And you see yourself on TV or PV, so you became aware of it right?

70
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,680
Yes.

71
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:58,060
What do you think of Ikoma? Shiraishi. Do you think she changed a lot?

72
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:00,480
Yes, i do think she grow a lot in Nogizaka46.

73
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:03,760
I see, members also think that way too....

74
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:08,400
Her outer beauty is changed into better one.

75
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,440
I'm happy <3

76
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,100
I see.

77
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,340
- Can we go to the next one?
- Ok, lets go!

78
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:16,280
Next topic is this!

79
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:21,060
Member who has lame fashion style.

80
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:24,060
At handshake event, you all go by your own dress right?
Yes.

81
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:32,840
So, because it's an event, you might give some effort so that you wont be recognised as a lame one,
But for staffs who see you everyday, they just think "that person just so lame."

82
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,400
They won't say it in front of you right?

83
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,340
Yes!

84
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,800
It's a definite answer. No one said that in front of the person.

85
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,860
Maybe they just "KAWAII" but in fact "Wow... So lame..."

86
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:45,660
I agree.

87
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,880
So who is she?

88
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:52,880
Let's start with number 3, the one who has a lame fashion style is this person!

89
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,060
Ikuchan!

90
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,260
For real?

91
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,840
She's just a bit retro.

92
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:05,120
I think you wear a dress properly right? Whenever there's staff around.

93
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,280
Yes, I do wear dress properly.

94
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:07,940
I see.

95
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:13,440
But at 16, you should be buy a lot of fashion mags and read it shouldn't you?

96
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:17,060
I just dont get the point of that kind of interest.

97
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:23,160
So, even you are choosen here, you dont feel anything like a curiousity about it?

98
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,100
Yes ^^

99
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:26,280
I see...

100
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,300
But she will change!

101
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,780
- I agree.
- Maybe...

102
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,600
She's just 16.

103
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:35,480
Like wearing whole branded costume like prada!

104
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:39,000
That's possible!

105
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:41,360
Right now, Himura is wearing whole vuitton costume.

106
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,180
That day will appear.

107
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:46,440
I don't know what's wrong with him.

108
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,640
He just like a rich chinese.

109
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:51,140
Yes.

110
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,960
Next one... No 2 is this person.

111
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,760
Takayama?

112
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:00,340
You are called here, Takayama!

113
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:01,280
Im shocked...

114
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,460
I bet.

115
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:04,900
You are not considering yourself wear lame fashion right?

116
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:09,360
If you see per item, they are cute but she can't mix them.

117
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,080
And, you wear brown too much.

118
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:18,740
And, that rucksack is a no!

119
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:26,220
Firstly, my dream is became a stylish!

120
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,560
That's one of the reason and...

121
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:32,280
- So you are confident with your style.
- I see.

122
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,740
Yes I do.

123
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:38,360
I see, that's shocking right. Being told as lame.

124
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:46,080
And last time, after recording, when it's aired.

125
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,100
At private item corner.

126
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,200
The fact is, I got that from my mother.

127
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,760
And at mail, my mother just apologize for it.

128
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,760
That's too sad.

129
00:07:57,260 --> 00:08:00,580
And she said, if you don't like it, don't wear it.

130
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:02,580
What's that? Too sad.

131
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:08,200
Then lets sent it back to your mother!

132
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:12,360
It's still alright that you wear brown a lot.

133
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,360
And someday you will be called mole.

134
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:24,240
But if they call you a mole, this is a sign that you are already being hated.

135
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:28,780
Next one... The one with lame style no 1 is this person.

136
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,700
All of you just agree with this right?

137
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:39,480
Sometime, she came wearing some sort of pajamas.

138
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,140
Almost all the time, she wear big dress...

139
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:45,620
Like one size bigger...

140
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:49,800
You wear it like someone from a village and wear worn-out shoes.

141
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:56,180
The truth, i just don't like to go out, so i rarely go shopping.

142
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:58,820
So i buy my dress once every 2 months.

143
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:00,300
But you still buying it.

144
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:03,200
So i wear the same dress over and over again, easy to wear.

145
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,480
You just overwear that one dress?

146
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:10,560
Yes. I wear same thing over and over.

147
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,540
That kind of person do exist.

148
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:14,900
Matsumura is only wearing pink.

149
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:17,060
Are you Hayashiya Ichimon?

150
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,840
Even Hayashiya have other colour.

151
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:27,020
And the reverse, the fashionable best 3 are...

152
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:31,820
Hashimoto, Nishino, Itou is the 1st!??

153
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:36,960
She is not catching the trend but make her own style.

154
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:41,460
Not the expensive one but the fittest one that she wear.

155
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:42,220
Thats good.

156
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:46,620
Do you have any photo of her dress? Lets see her fashion.

157
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,880
- This is blog?
- Yes, this is blog.

158
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,840
The middle is made by my mother.

159
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:56,180
Ah, your mother is someone in the apparel business?

160
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:58,180
My mother is an ex-fashion designer.

161
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:01,500
I design my dress and my mother make it for me.

162
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,160
What's that!

163
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,900
What a daughter-mother! So cool!

164
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:08,260
So your mother made those?

165
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:10,880
Then, you all just order from her mother.

166
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:14,560
Yes, especially the cute design.

167
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:17,260
Lets go to the next one. Next topic is this!

168
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:19,640
Member who love mirror.

169
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:26,680
This means that you are a narcist or love yourself.

170
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,460
No 3 is this person!

171
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,540
You, the one with lame fashion, what are you doing?

172
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,440
Everytime she just see a mirror and saying cute!

173
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:42,440
Is this true?

174
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,440
.... Yes it is.

175
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:47,040
You just see upper side from here right?

176
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,300
Aaa, like this line...

177
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:53,580
You have to see your lower parts.

178
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,580
Lets see no2. No 2 is this person!

179
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,060
She won't move from mirror.

180
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:11,160
That's true, because our job is being seen, if you dont always see mirror
and do checkup... I will get warnings...

181
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,500
Like, your nosehair is appearing?

182
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:31,460
Because my face is a bit hard, they always say, make a soft face or change your make-up or... And my Photos isn't that good, they said I should do more research. So i always see a mirror.

183
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:33,800
So you done it conciously.

184
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,520
But you don't do your own make up right?

185
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,260
Eh, there are members who did it by yourself?

186
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:41,040
So there are members who did and didn't?

187
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,920
The one who did it? Oh that's a lot. Why?

188
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,780
The one who can and can't!

189
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:49,600
Because there are lots of person, so the one who can do it, will do it by herself.

190
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:50,980
I see...

191
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:52,540
I can't do it!

192
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:54,280
So you are make up-ed by other?

193
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,020
Yes.

194
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:56,940
If you do it yourself, how is it look like? Is the lipstick will be like this?

195
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:59,200
It's not like that but...

196
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:04,720
And you make this pale blue and red lipstick.

197
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,340
We haven't announce no 1 yet, i never think she will be in. This person!

198
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,600
Hashimoto!

199
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:18,120
- Is it true Hashimoto?
- So different with what i imaged.

200
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:21,560
She check mirror every several minutes.

201
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:26,980
Glass, windows, she also see other reflecting things.

202
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:31,620
I, like Reika, are not good in the media.

203
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:32,360
What's that means?

204
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:38,200
Even from starting, my picture on photos and videos is not good.

205
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:44,860
And everytime i see myself, I just think it would be better to do this and that.

206
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:48,960
So, now before any recording or photoshoot, i will see myself first.

207
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:53,720
Do you decide your own make-up and hairstyle? Like this and that?

208
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:55,000
Yes.

209
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,640
Especially Takayama, you changed it alot.

210
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,940
Yes I do. Which one is better?

211
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,540
Are you going to do that conversation here?

212
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:09,960
Because it affecting your appearance....

213
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,760
Lets go to the next one, next topic is this!

214
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:15,760
Member who always late.

215
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:16,660
This is  not good!

216
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:19,080
This is not good!

217
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,080
Let us see no 3, no 3 is!

218
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:23,520
Itou Marika.

219
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,120
You are stylish though...

220
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:29,100
She will wake up if someone call her, and even she's late, she never apologize.

221
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,480
This is bad!

222
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,320
The staff have this kind of image!

223
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,440
I'm weak at waking up in early morning...

224
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,380
Everyone is!

225
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,100
Everyone is having difficulty to wake up early!

226
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,360
Indeed!

227
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,840
And you never apologize?

228
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:45,860
EH! I am apologized...

229
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:47,460
It's not reaching them!

230
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:49,460
It's scary...

231
00:13:51,980 --> 00:14:00,320
This is important! If you already apologize but it's never reaching them, it is same with not Apologizing!

232
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:04,680
This is causing a problem between your manager and their talents!

233
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,460
Lets go to no 2, no 2 is this person!

234
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,340
Captain!

235
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:13,580
- Captain this is not good!
- As captain you should not be ranked here!

236
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:15,960
I just waiting for other member to ...

237
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,960
LIAR!

238
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:25,500
You always say that you are waiting and confirming other members right...

239
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,160
You never did that!

240
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:36,060
I am slow at everything... I am not reasoning myself but being so slow...

241
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:38,460
As a captain, this is not a good thing!

242
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:42,140
Be quicker! But there is no 1!

243
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,940
The one who always late is this person!

244
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:46,940
Matsumura!

245
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,760
YOU what are you doing, since the begining...

246
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,740
I didn't do it lately...

247
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:54,560
You took all no 1 today...

248
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,300
HAPPY^^

249
00:14:55,380 --> 00:15:02,320
She won't be there every morning and she always have a wake-up hair when she came.

250
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,920
Yes... Thats true...

251
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:09,380
- But there is 1 more person...
- Yes, other one...

252
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:10,540
There is no.1 !?

253
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:11,660
The real no.1 ?

254
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,040
Who is she?

255
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:19,280
There she is! The actress, Hashimoto!

256
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:25,700
What are you doing? Like "PLEASE!!"

257
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,280
That's amazing...

258
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:33,760
So is it because you already became an actress?

259
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,020
It's not like that!

260
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:36,380
So you already bored?

261
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:43,940
No, back then I won't even wake up from emergency alarm!
Then my manager wake me up!

262
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,140
But I rushing out in 3 minutes!

263
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:47,480
Ow, our perparation is short!

264
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,800
Yes, so maybe staffs...

265
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,200
I see! I SEE!

266
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,800
So it means that no one know about this...

267
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,400
But i can't commenting about others...

268
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:00,220
So, everyday what are you doing at morning?

269
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:02,500
I do go early every morning!

270
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:05,140
It's hell!

271
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:10,560
Don't say it's hell! What do you mean by it's hell?!

272
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:14,840
Because i have responsibilities with my jobs.

273
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:21,700
But Himura is very precise about time! And I feel anxious because of that!

274
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:24,580
And I just gone mad and said WHY YOU NEVER LATE?

275
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:27,340
That kind of madness is impossible right?

276
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:31,360
When he see me at waiting room, he just yelled WHY ARE YOU HERE?

277
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,900
Next is this! The topis is...

278
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:43,060
Member who is troubling as lil sister.

279
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,480
Staffs also answer for this kind of question...

280
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,180
No 3 is this person!

281
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:56,900
Why? Because she will be a great lil sister i think.

282
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,900
Smart... Cute...

283
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,480
Her parents' education is good and she has no opening.

284
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:07,260
She will be in hyper mode when it is night time.

285
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:11,680
So at night, you will be overactive?

286
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:15,260
Yes, from 10 PM my mood is became strange...

287
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:16,640
The starting point is at 10 PM right?

288
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,820
Why?

289
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:19,540
I don't know, maybe i am a nocturnal.

290
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,160
A nocturnal?

291
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,740
It would be dangerous for you to attend a live night TV show.

292
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:26,440
Yes...

293
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,780
Like waaaa... Yeeeaaaa...

294
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,120
I am no 1!

295
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,400
Ikuchan!

296
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,400
Shut up!

297
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,140
Ikuchan!

298
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,320
You can see her like that, audiences.

299
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:52,140
That kind of sister isn't needed.

300
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,520
No 2 is this person!

301
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,500
- EEEHH why?
- Takayama!

302
00:17:58,620 --> 00:17:59,820
Why is it?

303
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:02,320
Her way of speaking is infectious.

304
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:07,960
And, if we go out together, and she suddenly shout "AMEIJINGU" it make me feels awkward.

305
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:17,860
There are staffs who don't like your "AMEIJINGU".

306
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:27,840
No 1 is unexpected! I do think she is the lil sister. This person!

307
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:31,320
This is unexpected.

308
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:35,260
There are lots of thing she can't do. This is so lil sister.

309
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:38,320
She will ask for something unexpected with that cuteness.

310
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,940
If she said something selfish with that voice, i can only follow.

311
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:49,800
So, they will feel pressure as big sister/brother.

312
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:51,760
Is this a good thing?

313
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,140
I don't think so!

314
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:56,020
It's very burdening.

315
00:18:56,540 --> 00:19:00,120
Cute face rank?

316
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:03,640
After this, announcement for cute face ranking?

317
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,480
Next, i will announce the topic later.

318
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:10,280
I will announce the rank first! This!

319
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:15,780
No 1 is Matsumura! 2 is Ikuta and 3 is Nishino!

320
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:19,460
What kind of ranking is this?

321
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:21,800
Matsumura, what do you think?

322
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,800
Cute face ranking?

323
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:29,240
I know you will say that!

324
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,300
Do you know it, Nishino?

325
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,600
Eating...

326
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:34,560
That's possible!

327
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:37,940
So what is this? Lets see the topic!

328
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,680
I see.

329
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,940
Gluttonous ranking!

330
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:51,000
No 3 Nishino. She always watching snacks...

331
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:53,960
You always watching foods?

332
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,240
Yes.

333
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,240
What kind of act is being observed!

334
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,000
Ikuta is ranked in...

335
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,200
Ikuta do eat!

336
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:05,600
Yes i do. If i don't eat, i feel upset.

337
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,680
She has obsession with foods.

338
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:19,420
Like, for lunchbox or onigiri, after she take one, she will take another as a spare.

339
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:23,200
They know it!

340
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,840
Of course they will know!

341
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:27,040
They do think you are a gluttonous.

342
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,040
I don't think that they know it ^^;

343
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:37,360
No 1 Matsumura is always take away lunchbox or snacks.

344
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:42,900
You always said it on TV... So you do so?

345
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:45,800
Yes! I love it.

346
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:50,940
Like, for someone's birthday, there will be a cake on the buss...
