00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:07,020
<font size="38">Tonight on NogiDoko, on sale on the 13th of March,</font>

2
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:09,930
<font size="38">We’ll have the big announcement of the senbatsu for the 5th single!</font>

3
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:11,970
<font size="38">Uwaa~ She made it in!!</font>

4
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:17,850
<font size="38">Filled with ups and downs and surprises, what is the conclusion of it?</font>

5
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:23,270
<font size="38">Nogizakatte, Doko?</font>

6
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:40,810
<font size="38">DON!</font>

7
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:45,270
<font size="38">Nogizakatte Doko has started, were you're hosts, 
Bananaman, yoroshiku onegaishimasu~</font>

8
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:46,810
<font size="38">YAY!</font>

9
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:50,060
<font size="38">Now, here's Nogizaka-chan~ 
hai, douzo~</font>

10
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:52,810
<font size="40"><b>Clang~</b></font>

11
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:53,770
<font size="38">Himura-san...</font>

12
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:55,600
<font size="38">they've boycotted us.</font>

13
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:59,560
<font size="38">If this is how it turns out, then we’ll do this by ourselves.</font>

14
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,100
<font size="38"></font>

15
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:02,720
<font size="38">Please announce what we have today.</font>

16
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:03,560
<font size="38">Understood.</font>

17
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,140
<font size="38">Our plan for today…</font>

18
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:12,100
<font size="38">Nogizaka46 big announcement of senbatsu members for the 5th single?!</font>

19
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:15,060
<font size="40"><b>Cling~</b></font>

20
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:17,680
<font size="38">So that's why they're not here, Himura-san.</font>

21
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:18,770
<font size="38">So, that's why.</font>

22
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:20,020
<font size="38">Yes, actually…</font>

23
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:24,560
<font size="38">Until now, we have gathered all 33 members in the studio</font>

24
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,810
<font size="38">and then have the announcement, but…</font>

25
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:29,100
<font size="38">if we do that, they’ll realize what’s going on.</font>

26
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,310
<font size="38">That’s why this time, we’ll confuse them a little,</font>

27
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:36,970
<font size="38">catch them off guard with a sudden 5th single announcement.</font>

28
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:37,970
<font size="38">This one’s really…</font>

29
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:40,220
<font size="38">I don’t have an idea about that, goes for you as well, right?</font>

30
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,390
<font size="38">That’s right, I don’t.</font>

31
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:44,810
<font size="38">On a certain day in December,</font>

32
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:49,270
<font size="38">all members are gathered in one place without knowing anything.</font>

33
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:50,890
<font size="38">And right there…</font>

34
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:55,890
<font size="38">Everyone in Nogizaka46, good morning.</font>

35
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:57,640
<font size="38">Good morning~</font>

36
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:00,640
<font size="38">Everyone is gathered here today…</font>

37
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,850
<font size="38">Whose voice is that?</font>

38
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:03,680
<font size="38">…for this.</font>

39
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,350
<font size="38">What is it??</font>

40
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:13,890
<font size="38">Seriously?!</font>

41
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:18,430
<font size="38">Very well, I will now explain how the senbatsu members will be announced.</font>

42
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:24,270
<font size="38">This time, the announcement venue is divided into three rooms,</font>

43
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:27,600
<font size="38">In the announcement room next to where the members are…</font>

44
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:31,890
<font size="38">Cards with the names of all of the members are placed.</font>

45
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:35,890
<font size="38">Once opened, if the number of the position is written, then she’s in the senbatsu.</font>

46
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:37,180
<font size="20">I see, 
up to 16 members, huh?</font>

47
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:41,310
<font size="38">Unfortunately, if it’s a blank paper, it means she’s not in the senbatsu.</font>

48
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:47,680
<font size="38">The members who made it in the senbatsu will move to the new senbatsu room.</font>

49
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:52,310
<font size="38">And here's the formation this time.</font>

50
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:57,060
<font size="38">Just like the last time, the eight members in the front will be the 8-Fukujin.</font>

51
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:02,100
<font size="38">The order of who will open their card is not determined,</font>

52
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:07,310
<font size="38">Acting with their own will, one by one from the person who wants to go, they will confirm their own result.</font>

53
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:08,180
<font size="20">I see.</font>

54
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:08,600
<font size="38">Furthermore,</font>

55
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:14,520
<font size="38">the counter in front of you shows the number of remaining senbatsu members.</font>

56
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,100
<font size="20">Ah, this one.</font>

57
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:18,810
<font size="38">If this counter reached zero, even if there are still members left in the room,</font>

58
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:22,220
<font size="38">it will mark the conclusion of the senbatsu announcement.</font>

59
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:22,970
<font size="38">Very well,</font>

60
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:27,350
<font size="38">From those who wants to go, please go to the next room and confirm.</font>

61
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:28,270
<font size="20">Eh? Starting off with 
those who wants to go?</font>

62
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:29,560
<font size="38">Please go ahead.</font>

63
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:31,220
<font size="38">Who will start this off?</font>

64
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:34,310
<font size="38">This is so harsh.</font>

65
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:36,930
<font size="38">Everyone’s spirit has departed already.</font>

66
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,560
<font size="38">Who will go first?</font>

67
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:43,560
<font size="38">Adding to the news about the sudden senbatsu announcement,</font>

68
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,560
<font size="20">Scary.</font>

69
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:45,890
<font size="38">is the strict rule that they have to voluntarily confirm their own result.</font>

70
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:51,430
<font size="20">That’s why... 
are they going to go?</font>

71
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:56,600
<font size="38">The courageous member who raised her hand first is…</font>

72
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,020
<font size="38">Oh?</font>

73
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:01,100
<font size="38">Ikoma...</font>

74
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:06,350
<font size="38">Ikoma breaks this open.</font>

75
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,810
<font size="38">The first one to go to the announcement room is…</font>

76
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:16,390
<font size="38">Ikoma Rina who has served as the center for all of the singles.</font>

77
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,720
<font size="20">It has come to this, Ikoma.</font>

78
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,600
<font size="38">Very well, Ikoma-san,</font>

79
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:28,810
<font size="38">Please open the card with your name written on it and confirm the result of your position.</font>

80
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:32,100
<font size="38">If a number is written on it, you made it in the senbatsu.</font>

81
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:35,560
<font size="38">If nothing is there, you are not in the senbatsu.</font>

82
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:39,720
<font size="20">Oh?</font>

83
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,520
<font size="20">#2!</font>

84
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:47,100
<font size="38">Ikoma Rina, for the fifth consecutive time is in Nogizaka46's center position!</font>

85
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:51,520
<font size="38">It is a position filled of painful memories.</font>

86
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,180
<font size="38">But...</font>

87
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:55,680
<font size="38">responsibly...</font>

88
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,470
<font size="38">I want to take the responsibility.</font>

89
00:04:58,470 --> 00:04:58,720
<font size="38">I'll do my best.</font>

90
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,220
<font size="20">She's the center.</font>

91
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:04,470
<font size="38">Ikoma-san's result is in.</font>

92
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,810
<font size="38">Here it is.</font>

93
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:13,140
<font size="38">Waiting for that countdown will make you numb.</font>

94
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:17,100
<font size="38"></font>

95
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:20,180
<font size="38">Well then, the next person please.</font>

96
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:24,270
<font size="38">It seems like they want to go but don’t want to at the same time.</font>

97
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,180
<font size="38">Who will go next?</font>

98
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:27,560
<font size="38">Oh, there she is!</font>

99
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,140
<font size="38">Who is it?</font>

100
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:29,100
<font size="38">Is it Matsumura?</font>

101
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,470
<font size="38">Oh.</font>

102
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:32,270
<font size="38">There she goes.</font>

103
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:39,270
<font size="38">Second one to raise their hand is Matsumura Sayuri who gets everyone fired up with her cheerful smile,</font>

104
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:41,270
<font size="38">her result is?</font>

105
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:43,180
<font size="38">Not good. This is scary.</font>

106
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:45,680
<font size="20">I see, Matsumura also entered 
the 7-Fukujin and 8-Fukujin.</font>

107
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,180
<font size="20">Oh?</font>

108
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:55,270
<font size="20">She made it in!</font>

109
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:55,850
<font size="20">She made it in!</font>

110
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:59,890
<font size="38">Continuing from the last time, Matsumura Sayuri made it in the 8-Fukujin!</font>

111
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:00,770
<font size="20">I see!</font>

112
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,560
<font size="38">Matsumura-san's result is in.</font>

113
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,560
<font size="38"></font>

114
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,140
<font size="38">Here it is.</font>

115
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:09,350
<font size="38">That’s how it is.</font>

116
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:14,520
<font size="38">That situation where someone went but the number didn’t change, 
it haven’t happened yet…</font>

117
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:17,600
<font size="38">Very well, the next person please.</font>

118
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:20,560
<font size="38">So far, we have those senbatsu members who were selected every time.</font>

119
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,640
<font size="38">Oh, there she is.</font>

120
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:24,850
<font size="38">Next one to go.</font>

121
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:26,310
<font size="38">Hashimoto, huh?</font>

122
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:32,140
<font size="38">Hashimoto Nanami who has showed numerous great efforts with her peculiar sensitivity,</font>

123
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:33,890
<font size="38">and the result is…</font>

124
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:36,180
<font size="20">The members who were once 
selected as a Fukujin went in first.</font>

125
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:37,100
<font size="38">#5</font>

126
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:39,220
<font size="20">Uwaaaa, she made it in!</font>

127
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:43,430
<font size="38">Just like the last time, Hashimoto impressively made it in the 8-Fukujin as well.</font>

128
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:44,680
<font size="20">8-Fukujin?</font>

129
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,680
<font size="38">Going next is...</font>

130
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:49,100
<font size="20">Oh?</font>

131
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,270
<font size="38">Indispensable in Nogizaka for her composure and tolerance,</font>

132
00:06:55,270 --> 00:07:00,810
<font size="38">Captain Sakurai’s result is…</font>

133
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:00,850
<font size="20">Oh, she made it in!</font>

134
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:02,640
<font size="38">#4</font>

135
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:05,890
<font size="38">Thank you very much.</font>

136
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:10,560
<font size="38">Sakurai as well, continuing from last time, impressively made it in the 8-Fukujin.</font>

137
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,680
<font size="38">omedetou~</font>

138
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,430
<font size="38">Going next is Shiraishi.</font>

139
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:16,350
<font size="20">She doesn’t look good coming in.</font>

140
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:16,640
<font size="20">You’re right.</font>

141
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:21,720
<font size="38">All-rounder Shiraishi Mai who has a sense of stability and unquestioned popularity and abilities,</font>

142
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,220
<font size="38">her result is…</font>

143
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:24,180
<font size="20">Are you okay, Shiraishi?</font>

144
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:26,810
<font size="20">She’s in.</font>

145
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:28,850
<font size="20">She’s in the 8-Fukujin.</font>

146
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:34,680
<font size="38">We were suddenly told about the announcement today,</font>

147
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:41,470
<font size="38">to be honest, I wasn’t really prepared for it, but…</font>

148
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:50,100
<font size="38">It would be nice if I could be someone who can lead everyone.</font>

149
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:53,560
<font size="20">Ah, Ikuta.</font>

150
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:58,430
<font size="38">Musical talent and responses in variety,</font>

151
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:02,720
<font size="38">she has demonstrated her diverse power, Ikuta Erika’s result is…</font>

152
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:05,020
<font size="38">#1</font>

153
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:05,020
<font size="20">#1!</font>

154
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:05,770
<font size="20">Oh!</font>

155
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:12,060
<font size="38">So far, six of the 8-Fukujin who entered the new senbatsu are determined.</font>

156
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:14,890
<font size="38">10 spots remaining.</font>

157
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:15,810
<font size="38">Very well, the next person please.</font>

158
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:17,520
<font size="20">Won’t there be any 
changes in the 8-Fukujin?</font>

159
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:25,640
<font size="38">Given the situation, it’ll be hard for those at the back to come forth.</font>

160
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,390
<font size="38">Those two at the front aren’t going yet.</font>

161
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:30,350
<font size="38">-Because of their fear of not making it in the senbatsu,</font>

162
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:34,350
<font size="38">the members couldn’t get up from their seats.</font>

163
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:38,270
<font size="38">The next person please.</font>

164
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:41,770
<font size="38">Ah, so strict. No one from the under has gone yet.</font>

165
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:43,390
<font size="38">They’re scared.</font>

166
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:46,930
<font size="38">-Those who think they’d make it since they did their best should go.</font>

167
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:49,520
<font size="38">So far, everyone who went made it in.</font>

168
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:52,430
<font size="38">Oh! There she is! Who is it?</font>

169
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:53,180
<font size="38">-Who is it?</font>

170
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:58,680
<font size="38">As expected, Hatanaka is the man~</font>

171
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,720
<font size="38">That girl will do anything.</font>

172
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:01,810
<font size="20">Admirable.</font>

173
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:04,430
<font size="38">In the situation where no one can move because of fear,</font>

174
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:05,310
<font size="38">she mustered up her courage,</font>

175
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:07,850
<font size="38">Hatakana is the only one who stood up from her seat.</font>

176
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:08,100
<font size="38">Will she make it in after making it in the 2nd single?</font>

177
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:08,970
<font size="20">You can do this,</font>

178
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:11,640
<font size="20">Go Hatanaka!</font>

179
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:14,970
<font size="20">Eh? She didn’t make it 
since the 2nd single.</font>

180
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:19,890
<font size="38">Will Hatanaka’s courage be rewarded?</font>

181
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,020
<font size="20">No way!</font>

182
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:23,560
<font size="20">Seriously?</font>

183
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,100
<font size="38"></font>

184
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:28,020
<font size="38">Please tell how you feel right now while facing the camera.</font>

185
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,430
<font size="20">This is so cruel.</font>

186
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:31,140
<font size="38">I'm frustrated but...</font>

187
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:35,270
<font size="38">there are still parts where I’m lacking.</font>

188
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:40,850
<font size="38">For the next single…</font>

189
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:43,100
<font size="38">I’ll do my best in order to make it in the senbatsu.</font>

190
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,430
<font size="20">So harsh!</font>

191
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:44,970
<font size="20">This is so harsh!</font>

192
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:47,680
<font size="38">Hatanaka-san's result is in.</font>

193
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:50,100
<font size="38">Here it is.</font>

194
00:09:53,270 --> 00:10:03,220
<font size="38"></font>

195
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:06,390
<font size="38">The mood is gloomy.</font>

196
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:12,680
<font size="38">For the first time, they saw firsthand a failure of making it in the senbatsu,</font>

197
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:16,220
<font size="38">and the fear grows further.</font>

198
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:21,390
<font size="38">In this situation, the one who got up from her seat is…</font>

199
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:25,560
<font size="38">Oh?</font>

200
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:31,850
<font size="38">Wakatsuki is admirable.</font>

201
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:36,390
<font size="38">Wakatsuki has entered the senbatsu starting from the 3rd single,</font>

202
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:40,060
<font size="38">will she make it for three consecutive times?</font>

203
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:40,640
<font size="20">Cool!</font>

204
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,310
<font size="20">Oh? There it is!</font>

205
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:50,310
<font size="38">Wakatsuki who never lacks effort and always grinding out 
made it in the senbatsu for the third consecutive time!</font>

206
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:54,270
<font size="38">And then, the 9th member who got up from her seat is…</font>

207
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:58,020
<font size="38">Oh? Uwaaa.</font>

208
00:10:58,470 --> 00:10:59,350
<font size="38">Who is it?</font>

209
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:00,020
<font size="38">Oh?</font>

210
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:01,220
<font size="38">Nakada!</font>

211
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:02,220
<font size="38">Nakada.</font>

212
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,520
<font size="38">Nakada who had experienced not making it in the senbatsu last time</font>

213
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:10,520
<font size="38">mustered her courage and proceeded to the announcement room.</font>

214
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:13,390
<font size="38">Will she make her way back to the senbatsu?</font>

215
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:14,270
<font size="20">Will she be back?</font>

216
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:19,060
<font size="38">Or will she taste the bitterness of not making it in the senbatsu once again?</font>

217
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:22,560
<font size="38">The result is?</font>

218
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:26,850
<font size="20">Oh? She made it in!</font>

219
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:30,060
<font size="38">Nakada Kana impressively made her way back from Under,</font>

220
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:30,850
<font size="20">Whoa.</font>

221
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:32,430
<font size="20">She made her way back.</font>

222
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,220
<font size="38">congrats for making it in the senbatsu!</font>

223
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:37,680
<font size="38">Which means it is determined that someone from the senbatsu won’t make it.</font>

224
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,890
<font size="38">-I see.</font>

225
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:40,270
<font size="38">Kana, welcome back~</font>

226
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,060
<font size="38">I'm back~</font>

227
00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:00,470
<font size="38">Good for you~</font>

228
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:02,850
<font size="38">Nakada-san's result is in.</font>

229
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,640
<font size="38">Here it is.</font>

230
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:19,100
<font size="38">Under’s Nakada Kana making it in the senbatsu would mean that…</font>

231
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:23,890
<font size="38">one of the current senbatsu members will go to Under for sure.</font>

232
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:29,720
<font size="38">Very well, the next person please.</font>

233
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,970
<font size="38">onegaishimasu</font>

234
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:37,390
<font size="38">Fukagawa!</font>

235
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:38,220
<font size="38">There she is.</font>

236
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:43,390
<font size="38">Fukagawa fulfilled her desire to be in the senbatsu during the 3rd single,</font>

237
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:46,600
<font size="38">will she make it in for three consecutive times?</font>

238
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:50,810
<font size="38">the result is…</font>

239
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:52,850
<font size="38">Thank you very much.</font>

240
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:54,100
<font size="20">She made it in right?</font>

241
00:12:57,930 --> 00:13:03,020
<font size="38">The oneesan who motivates everyone with her innate cheerfulness, 
Fukagawa Mai made it in the senbatsu!</font>

242
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:03,520
<font size="20">Only seven remaining.</font>

243
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:06,270
<font size="38">Going next is Hoshino Minami,</font>

244
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:08,100
<font size="38">her result is…</font>

245
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:10,560
<font size="20">She made it in!</font>

246
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:16,560
<font size="38">She singlehandedly expanded the scope of their activities, 
Hoshino Minami made it in the 8-Fukujin!</font>

247
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:22,140
<font size="38">More surprises after this?!</font>

248
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:29,180
<font size="38">10 members of the senbatsu are determined, 6 remaining.</font>

249
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:32,140
<font size="38">In this situation, the one who got up from her seat is…</font>

250
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:36,770
<font size="38">Uwaa, amazing!</font>

251
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:40,810
<font size="38">Coming from Under.</font>

252
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:46,600
<font size="38">So far, Ito Nene never made it in the senbatsu,</font>

253
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,680
<font size="38">will she be able to have her most desired wish of being in the senbatsu?</font>

254
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:54,430
<font size="20">Which one is it?</font>

255
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:56,680
<font size="20">What did she get?</font>

256
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,430
<font size="20">There it is!</font>

257
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:01,850
<font size="20">Uwaa, she made it in!</font>

258
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:02,430
<font size="20">She made it!</font>

259
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:03,600
<font size="20">Amazing!</font>

260
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:07,350
<font size="20">She made it in the senbatsu!</font>

261
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:08,560
<font size="20">Good for her~</font>

262
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,180
<font size="38">I can't believe this.</font>

263
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:11,680
<font size="20">Her first one.</font>

264
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:18,350
<font size="38">She even served as center in Under, everyone’s imouto,</font>

265
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:20,810
<font size="38">Ito Nene impressively made it in the senbatsu!</font>

266
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,600
<font size="38">Uwaaaaaaa!!! Nene!!!</font>

267
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:39,520
<font size="38">omedetou~</font>

268
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:43,680
<font size="38">Ito-san's result is in.</font>

269
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:44,930
<font size="38"></font>

270
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:57,770
<font size="38">With this, two of the current senbatsu members are out.</font>

271
00:14:57,770 --> 00:14:58,390
<font size="38">I see.</font>

272
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:04,930
<font size="38">With this, it's certain that two of the current senbatsu members won’t make it.</font>

273
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:08,060
<font size="38">Right here, the one who got up from her seat is…</font>

274
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:20,020
<font size="38">Ito Marika made it in the senbatsu once during the 3rd single,</font>

275
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:23,020
<font size="38">will she make it in the senbatsu and turn the tables?</font>

276
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:25,850
<font size="38">her result is…</font>

277
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:29,390
<font size="20">Uwaaa. Nothing’s in it.</font>

278
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:31,720
<font size="38">There's nothing in it.</font>

279
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:35,390
<font size="38">Ito Nene had gone, and with that flow,</font>

280
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:38,020
<font size="38">I went by it.</font>

281
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:41,810
<font size="38">I went without having confidence.</font>

282
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:46,930
<font size="38">Once again, as an Under…</font>

283
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:51,850
<font size="38">I’d like to do my best.</font>

284
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:55,140
<font size="38">Ito-san's result is in.</font>

285
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:02,220
<font size="38">Remaining current senbatsu members</font>

286
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:04,430
<font size="38">Takayama, Inoue and Ichiki hasn’t gone yet.</font>

287
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:06,930
<font size="38">The next person please.</font>

288
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:06,930
<font size="38"></font>

289
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:07,850
<font size="38">HAI!</font>

290
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,930
<font size="38">She has voice and reaction louder and bigger than anyone else,</font>

291
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:19,600
<font size="38">Nogizaka’s moodmaker, Nagashima Seira went to the announcement room to gamble for her first senbatsu selection.</font>

292
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,520
<font size="20">How will this turn out?</font>

293
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,140
<font size="20">UWAAAAAA!</font>

294
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:25,100
<font size="20">She made it in!</font>

295
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,180
<font size="20">She made it.</font>

296
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:27,270
<font size="20">It’s her first one!</font>

297
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:32,970
<font size="38">I’m really happy.</font>

298
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,060
<font size="38">Finally, her most desired wish of getting in the senbatsu,</font>

299
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:35,770
<font size="20">Amazing!</font>

300
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:36,640
<font size="38">she’ll be able to perform with her close friend Shiraishi.</font>

301
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,810
<font size="20">Three from the Under made it in.</font>

302
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:39,850
<font size="20">Three of them made it in.</font>

303
00:16:47,850 --> 00:17:00,140
<font size="38">I’m so happy!</font>

304
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:01,970
<font size="38">Good for you~</font>

305
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:04,220
<font size="38">Good for you~</font>

306
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,680
<font size="38">I'm so happy, what to do~</font>

307
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:11,720
<font size="38">omedetou~</font>

308
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,770
<font size="38">Thank you.</font>

309
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:16,470
<font size="38">I’m really happy for you~</font>

310
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:18,350
<font size="20">Nakada, Ito Nene and Nagashima</font>

311
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:19,680
<font size="38">Nagashima's result is in.</font>

312
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,810
<font size="20">the three of them made it in.</font>

313
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:23,470
<font size="38">Here it is.</font>

314
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:29,890
<font size="38">Only four people left, because of this.</font>

315
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:33,140
<font size="38">It became difficult for the current senbatsu to go there.</font>

316
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:36,060
<font size="38">Next person please.</font>

317
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:38,220
<font size="38">Ah, Takayama?</font>

318
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:41,680
<font size="38">Takayama.</font>

319
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:47,470
<font size="38">From the current senbatsu members, it is certain that two won’t make it,</font>

320
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:50,270
<font size="38">Takayama’s result is…</font>

321
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,310
<font size="38">POSITIVE & AMAZING!</font>

322
00:17:57,310 --> 00:18:00,430
<font size="38">Takayama Kazumi impressively made it in the senbatsu!</font>

323
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:01,640
<font size="20">Three remaining.</font>

324
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:04,770
<font size="38">Going next is Nishino Nanase.</font>

325
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:08,060
<font size="38">Can she fulfill her most wanted wish of getting in the 8-Fukujin?</font>

326
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,680
<font size="38">There it is.</font>

327
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,520
<font size="38">There it is.</font>

328
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:14,810
<font size="38">Her wish of getting in the 8-Fukujin didn’t come true,</font>

329
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:15,220
<font size="20">Two left.</font>

330
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:17,390
<font size="38">nonetheless, Nishino made it in the senbatsu.</font>

331
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:18,520
<font size="20">And one of the 8-Fukujin.</font>

332
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:23,430
<font size="38">Noujo, Saito Asuka, Inoue, Ichiki, Akimoto.</font>

333
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:27,470
<font size="38">Among these five, it is certain that three of them won’t make it.</font>

334
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:30,640
<font size="38">Very well, next person please.</font>

335
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:33,600
<font size="20">Who is it?</font>

336
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:38,600
<font size="38">Up to this point, Ichiki never fell off the senbatsu,</font>

337
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:42,310
<font size="38">will she make it in the senbatsu for the fifth consecutive time?</font>

338
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:52,180
<font size="20">Oh.</font>

339
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:54,100
<font size="20">Seriously?</font>

340
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,890
<font size="20">Ichiki didn’t make it.</font>

341
00:18:56,850 --> 00:19:02,520
<font size="38">I have been chosen up until the 4th single, so...</font>

342
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:06,520
<font size="38">I’m really grateful for that.</font>

343
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:12,930
<font size="38">Congratulations to everyone who became a senbatsu member.</font>

344
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:15,850
<font size="38">Ichiki-san's result is in.</font>

345
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:17,310
<font size="38">Here it is.</font>

346
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:28,680
<font size="38">Very well, next person please.</font>

347
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,640
<font size="38">Ah, Akimoto.</font>

348
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:34,520
<font size="38">She finally moved, Akimoto.</font>

349
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,720
<font size="38"></font>

350
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:43,560
<font size="38">Last time, Akimoto made a shocking entry in the senbatsu by being a 8-Fukujin all of the sudden,</font>

351
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:47,430
<font size="38">her result is…</font>

352
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,220
<font size="20">She made it in.</font>

353
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:55,430
<font size="20">8-Fukujin</font>

354
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:02,390
<font size="38">Akimoto Manatsu made it in the 8-Fukujin for two consecutive times!</font>

355
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:04,060
<font size="38">omedetou~</font>

356
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:08,970
<font size="38">I never really thought that I’d be chosen today.</font>

357
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:11,680
<font size="38">Coming in here was really scary.</font>

358
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,930
<font size="38">Akimoto-san's result is in.</font>

359
00:20:15,770 --> 00:20:17,020
<font size="38">Here it is.</font>

360
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:27,470
<font size="38">Remaining current senbatsu members</font>

361
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:32,350
<font size="38">At last, we’re down to the last one.</font>

362
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:35,350
<font size="38">Will it end without them seeing the result for themselves?</font>

363
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:39,890
<font size="38">Or will they muster up their courage and try?</font>

364
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,020
<font size="38">There goes Noujo.</font>

365
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:53,140
<font size="38">Last time, Noujo Ami impressively returned to the senbatsu,</font>

366
00:20:53,140 --> 00:21:05,810
<font size="38">will she able to achieve two consecutive selections in a row?</font>

367
00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:06,310
<font size="20">Too bad.</font>

368
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:09,100
<font size="38">The result is out already,</font>

369
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:12,220
<font size="38">and I’ll accept this result.</font>

370
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:15,060
<font size="38">Once again,</font>

371
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:17,270
<font size="38">from the start,</font>

372
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:21,060
<font size="38">I'd like to do my best.</font>

373
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,890
<font size="38">Noujo-san's result is in.</font>

374
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:26,310
<font size="38">Here it is.</font>

375
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:34,350
<font size="38">Last one.</font>

376
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:37,600
<font size="38">Very well, the next person please.</font>

377
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:41,390
<font size="38">There she is.</font>

378
00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:43,060
<font size="38">Saito Asuka</font>

379
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:49,810
<font size="38">Last time, the youngest member, Saito Asuka fulfilled her wish of making it in the senbatsu,</font>

380
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:53,430
<font size="38">will she make it in for two consecutive times?</font>

381
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:56,850
<font size="38">UWAAAA!</font>

382
00:21:56,970 --> 00:21:58,520
<font size="38">Are you serious?!</font>

383
00:21:58,810 --> 00:22:00,890
<font size="38">Looking back…</font>

384
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:08,680
<font size="38">I haven’t done anything in order for me to retain my spot in the 5th single,</font>

385
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:13,640
<font size="38">I’d like to grow more with the opportunity in Under.</font>

386
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:18,060
<font size="38">Saito Asuka-san's result is in.</font>

387
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,890
<font size="38">Here it is.</font>

388
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:28,930
<font size="38">Very well, the next person please.</font>

389
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:29,640
<font size="38">Will Inoue go?</font>

390
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,520
<font size="38">There she goes.</font>

391
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:39,680
<font size="38">With her innate competitive spirit, Inoue Sayuri has challenged various things,</font>

392
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:43,100
<font size="38">will she make it in the senbatsu for the fifth consecutive time?</font>

393
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,350
<font size="20">Ah! There it is!</font>

394
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:49,310
<font size="20">I see, Inoue.</font>

395
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:51,930
<font size="20">So that’s how it goes.</font>

396
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:55,600
<font size="38">Inoue impressively made it in the senbatsu,</font>

397
00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:00,310
<font size="38">with that, the 16 senbatsu members for the 5th single are finally determined!</font>

398
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:08,560
<font size="38">Thus, a tough and long day finally came to a close…</font>

399
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:12,140
<font size="38">This one, once again…</font>

400
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:15,560
<font size="38">is different from the other announcements that we had so far.</font>

401
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,770
<font size="38">It was harsh.</font>

402
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:19,680
<font size="38">For Takayama as well, do you feel like you couldn’t go?</font>

403
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:23,220
<font size="38">Truth is… since it is so negative…</font>

404
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:24,020
<font size="40"><b>Don’t put it that way…</b></font>

405
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:26,350
<font size="38">Don’t say something like that!</font>

406
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:29,970
<font size="38">Say something positive! Even if it’s half-hearted!</font>

407
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:32,140
<font size="38">Say an inspiring cheer.</font>

408
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:33,770
<font size="38">Positive say!</font>

409
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:35,770
<font size="38"></font>
