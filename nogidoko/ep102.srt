19
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,610
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">We've heard some things from Hashimoto's little brother</font>

20
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:35,250
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">As to what it is, here it is!</font>

24
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:45,830
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">But honestly speaking I somehow knew that Hashimoto is kind of sadistic</font>

<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Sister!</font>

133
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,580
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Your sister said none of that sort happened</font>

134
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:18,660
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">And that never happened at all</font>

135
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:20,510
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">I've never heard mother call her that once before</font>

136
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:28,250
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">"My child is actually OOOO" 
 The next informant is Nishino's mother</font>

137
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:30,020
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">We've heard this from your mother</font>

138
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:31,180
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">What is it about? Here!</font>

139
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,940
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">She is actually a slob!</font>

140
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:36,270
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">This doesn't fit the image you have, you seem to have a neat and proper image</font>

141
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:37,280
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">That's right!</font>

142
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:40,690
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Here is an episode about your slobbiness</font>

143
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:43,570
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">You will instantly take off your socks</font>

144
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:46,800
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">You will throw them about 3m away once you've taken off your socks</font>

145
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:48,360
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">But that's still cute!</font>

146
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:50,960
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">This doesn't fit your image at all!</font>

147
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,640
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">She sometimes just take things out from the fridge and leave them lying around</font>

148
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,520
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">And I have to clean it up</font>

149
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:57,900
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">What is this?</font>

150
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:58,680
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">What did you do?</font>

151
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,210
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Why did you do this?</font>

152
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:01,110
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">This happened quite a long time ago</font>

153
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:03,720
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">I don't like wearing socks at home, that's why once I reach home I would take them off immediately</font>

154
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,600
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">When you reach home?</font>

155
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:08,570
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">And doing so made me feel like throwing my socks</font>

156
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:12,210
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">You don't throw them into the washing machine?</font>

157
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:12,740
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">I don't, it's nothing near that</font>

158
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:15,570
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Oh so you don't aim for a specific target to throw them?</font>

159
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:19,940
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">I get the urge to throw them at random spots so I throw them</font>

160
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:21,000
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Why is that so?</font>

161
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:22,380
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Could you demonstrate?</font>

162
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:27,040
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">With that said, Nishino reenacts the scene</font>

163
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:28,330
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Say you're home</font>

164
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:30,130
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">I'm home~</font>

165
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,400
<font size="40"><b>{\an5}Crude</b></font>

166
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,250
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Wait wait ..</font>

167
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:37,960
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">That's far!</font>

168
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,790
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">What are you doing!</font>

169
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:40,470
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">What's that!</font>

170
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:41,790
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">What the hell are you doing</font>

171
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:44,170
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">What's with that unwillingness?</font>

172
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,940
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">You want to feel released?</font>

173
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:50,620
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">The feeling is like "I'm home!"</font>

174
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:53,450
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">The socks might end up behind the fridge</font>

175
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:57,670
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">It's no good that your mother is the one that picks them up, it might still be okay if you were the one that picked them up</font>

176
00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:59,470
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Yes, that isn't good</font>

177
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:00,470
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">I'll change my ways</font>

178
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:02,750
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Good</font>

179
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:05,250
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Let's move on, the next person is this!</font>

180
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:06,730
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Ikuta!</font>

181
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:08,400
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Ikuta you're up</font>

182
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,700
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">What is she actually like? Here it is!</font>

183
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,100
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">The truth is she actually has a weird habit!</font>

184
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:19,930
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">When my daughter concentrates on something, the back of her leg gets abnormally hot</font>

185
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:22,070
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">When that happens she has the habit of taking off her socks and throwing them at random places</font>

186
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:23,580
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">YOU TOO!?</font>

187
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:23,960
<font size="40"><b>{\an5}Habit of throwing socks 
 at random places</b></font>

188
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,120
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Why do you both have the same habits!</font>

189
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:26,870
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Overlap!</font>

190
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:32,220
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">When I concentrate, this part of my leg becomes warm</font>

191
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:33,780
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">I understand that feeling!</font>

192
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:38,540
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Each time I just feel like taking off my socks</font>

193
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,230
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">And my mother picks them up for me</font>

194
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:42,350
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">As expected it's your mother that does the tidying up</font>

195
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:43,450
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">That's right</font>

196
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:47,130
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">It's hard on your mother to tidy up after you, right?</font>

197
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:47,620
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Ah, hello~</font>

198
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:49,430
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">EHHHHHHHHHHHH!?</font>

199
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:50,380
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Hi there!</font>

200
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:51,850
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Hi, thanks for always taking care of us</font>

201
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:54,270
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Same here!</font>

202
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:55,640
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Ehh!? Wow!</font>

203
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,070
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">EHHHH!?</font>

204
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:56,920
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Mama~!</font>

205
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:59,480
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">We were just talking about the matter about her throwing her socks all over the place</font>

206
00:07:59,480 --> 00:07:59,960
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Yes</font>

207
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,350
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Do you tidy them up after her?</font>

208
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:02,000
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Yes I do</font>

209
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,400
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Under her study desk, or under the piano there's about 3 pairs of socks rolled up</font>

210
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:11,690
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">So I pick them up</font>

211
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:14,690
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">And I think to myself "She did it again" and put them into the washing machine</font>

212
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:15,480
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">That's the usual pattern</font>

213
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,780
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Ahhhhhh</font>

214
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:17,590
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Oh so that's it</font>

215
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:18,220
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Yes</font>

216
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:19,860
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">She doesn't tidy them up herself?</font>

217
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:22,380
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">The socks land in hidden places which are usually overlooked</font>

218
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:23,540
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Oh I see</font>

219
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:24,410
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Yes</font>

220
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:25,410
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">And furthermore, mother</font>

221
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:25,880
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Yes</font>

222
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:29,300
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Chancing upon this, you have a request right?</font>

223
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:31,230
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Yes that's right, umm...</font>

224
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:35,490
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">My daughter doesn't really know how to pick and buy her own clothes</font>

225
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:37,630
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">She doesn't have that kind of fashion sense</font>

226
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:40,100
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">She always tells me to buy clothes for her because she doesn't have the time to go shopping</font>

227
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,690
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Oh, you buy clothes for her?</font>

228
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:42,480
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">That's right!</font>

229
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,050
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Yes</font>

230
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:47,920
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Himura-san, there seems to be a segment where you bring the girls to buy clothes for them</font>

231
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,670
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">It isn't a segment in this show!</font>

232
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:51,800
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">That isn't a planned segment of this show!</font>

233
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,020
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">We did that previously right?</font>

234
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:53,020
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Yes we did that some time back</font>

235
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:55,490
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">If there is a next time to this segment...</font>

236
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:57,260
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">By all means, please bring my daughter along too</font>

237
00:08:57,260 --> 00:09:00,020
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Mother!</font>

238
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:01,130
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Yay!</font>

239
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,590
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Of course I would pay the cost of the clothes</font>

240
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:10,550
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">This has turned into you just earnestly wanting her to go and buy her own clothes</font>

241
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,620
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Yes that's right 
 What am I to Ikuta?</font>

242
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:17,050
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Since her mother is coming up with the money, why not let's have this segment once again?</font>

243
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:17,640
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">That's right</font>

244
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,000
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Okay I understand then</font>

245
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,740
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Yay!</font>

246
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:21,260
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Shall we go sometime then?</font>

247
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:21,610

00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:26,240
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">I get it, if there is a chance we will do that</font>

251
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:26,900

<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Are you okay?</font>

257
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:42,300
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">What is wrong?</font>

260
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:54,800
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Like for example, gestures or words that would make fans kyun</font>

323
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:35,780

328
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,200

329
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,010

330
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:49,410
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">She winked at me!</font>

354
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:32,310
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">But there was something different ..</font>

355
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:35,640
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Yeah but the way you closed up the distance between you two, wasn't that good?</font>

356
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:41,020
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">The pressure she put on my wrist made it felt like she wanted to dislocate my wrist</font>

367
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:11,090
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">We did that in the previous episode right?</font>

368
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:13,240
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Yes, this is the sequel to that</font>

369
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:19,650
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">A talent that the members themselves don't think is so-so but family members think that it would become popular</font>

370
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:23,790
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Tonight, the members would have to fufill this unreasonable task!</font>

371
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:27,630
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">The next informant is Wada's mother</font>

372
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:30,810
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">What is her talent?</font>

373
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,350

374
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:34,400
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Oh, the kick in karate?</font>

375
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,860
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">This wouldn't become popular!</font>

376
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:37,460
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Ah? You learned karate?</font>

377
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:40,610
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">I did learn, but this definitely wouldn't become popular</font>

378
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:44,880
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">But your mother said that you might even be able to break a wooden plank</font>

379
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,290
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">I have never even tried to break that before!</font>

380
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:48,210

382
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:52,620
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">She didn't say you would definitely be able to break it</font>

383
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:53,710
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">She didn't say you can break it</font>

384
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:56,940
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Your mother said that you might .. be able to break them, so why don't you give it a try?</font>

385
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:57,750
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Try it! 
 Oh!</font>

386
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:01,430
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">I have never tried that before! 
 But if you're able to break them, you might get offers from TV programs</font>

387
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:03,560
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">This is good, you would be able to make use of this 
 Mmm...</font>

388
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:08,910
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">With that said, without any prior experience, Wada will try to break a wooden plank</font>

389
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:11,510
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Hold it like this

390
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:12,520
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">And then from here you do this</font>

391
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,590
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">What's that?</font>

395
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:19,880
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Now let's begin</font>

00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:37,840
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">For real?</font>

532
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,500
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Its an encouraging praise</font>

533
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:44,460
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Perhaps thanks to her practicing, there was an improvement in her catchball</font>

534
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:51,600
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">For Shiraishi, the famous Tanaka gives her advice on how to avoid a double bound</font>

535
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:54,720
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Aoyama also lent his support</font>

536
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,830
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">While he was helping, Ikoma and Matsumura went up to the batter box and bat</font>

537
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:00,560
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">And then ..</font>

538
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:03,900
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Good luck! 
 You have never seen him pitch before right?</font>

539
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,390
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Uwahhhh!!</font>

540
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:07,130
<font size="40"><b>{\an5}Frozen</b></font>

541
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:08,510
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">You're kidding us! 
 That's impossible to hit!</font>

542
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:10,250
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">It would be 'delicious' for TV if you hit it</font>

543
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:13,730
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Matsumura that's dangerous!</font>

544
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:14,590
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Stop that!</font>

545
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:21,790
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Am I still in one piece?</font>

546
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:25,730
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">No matter where the batter stands, whether the distance between the catcher and the batter is narrower or not</font>

547
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:28,750
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">The zone for a strike doesn't change</font>

548
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:33,650
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Basically if you throw the ball above the baseline to the catcher, it would be considered as a strike</font>

549
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:35,210
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">You don't really have to care where the batter stands</font>

550
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:36,370
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">I understand</font>

551
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:40,300
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">After taking the advice from Tanaka and Aoyama sportsmen to heart</font>

552
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:44,760
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">The time for the revenge pitch creeps up!</font>

553
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:49,810
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">The previous time, I was too impatient and nervous</font>

554
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:51,220
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">And I threw the ball immediately</font>

555
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:52,900
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">This time I would calm myself down first</font>

556
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:55,480
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">I would confirm the other player's standing positions before throwing the pitch</font>

557
00:21:55,480 --> 00:22:01,560
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">And strengthen my will and resolve and all that's left is for the actual pitch</font>

558
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:05,760
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">And the time for the revenge pitch comes ..</font>

559
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:08,540
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Today, Nogizaka46's Shiraishi Mai would throw the opening pitch</font>

560
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:10,010
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">I'll be in your care!</font>

561
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:12,020
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Sorry, I'll be in your care</font>

562
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:17,800
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">On 9 July, at the Tokyo Dome match, Shiraishi threw the opening pitch</font>

563
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:22,190
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Due to nervousness, she threw the pitch which bounced twice</font>

564
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:23,690
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">I'm starting to feel nervous, what should I do!</font>

565
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:28,950
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Today, it's her chance for revenge!</font>

566
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:33,460
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">With that said, Shiraishi please throw the opening pitch!</font>

567
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:38,880
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Ahh! I'm nervous!</font>

568
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:47,710
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">With the members and audience looking over her</font>

569
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:51,250
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">How would Shiraishi's pitch go?</font>

570
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,420
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Ah! I'm Sorry!</font>

571
00:22:56,420 --> 00:23:01,890
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Amazing! Shiraishi Mai!</font>

572
00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:07,520
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Shiraishi's pitch bounced once before being received by the catcher</font>

573
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:11,200
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">It was an improvement over the last time</font>

574
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:15,780
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">She barely misses her chance for revenge</font>

575
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,860
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">And then...</font>

576
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,500
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">2 bounces, 1 bounce, the next time would be a strike!</font>

577
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,970
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">I'm really sorry about it!</font>

578
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,350
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Maiyan it's okay!</font>

579
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:29,220
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">I was no good, I can't stand there anymore</font>

580
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:31,040
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">It's going to be okay</font>

581
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,620
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">I'm sorry...</font>

582
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:35,410
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Sorry..</font>

583
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:36,500
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">It's okay</font>

584
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:37,210
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">But I really did screw up</font>

585
00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:39,100
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">You don't have to apologize</font>

586
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:47,510
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">I remembered the pressure I felt at Tokyo Dome</font>

587
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:52,800
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">I didn't threw the ball as far as I thought I could be able to</font>

588
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:56,700
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">But somehow</font>

589
00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:07,860
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Things went better than the previous time but I still have some vexing feelings about this</font>

590
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:11,470
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">I'll reflect on this</font>

591
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:14,060
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">But it was fun!</font>

592
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:18,920
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46"></font>

593
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:30,360
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46"></font>

594
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:38,790
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46"></font>

595
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:44,780
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46"></font>

596
00:24:55,610 --> 00:24:59,470
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46"></font>
