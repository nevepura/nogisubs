20
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:20,200
<font size="34">It's going to be Shichifukujin plus another 9 members.</font>

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,640
<font size="34">So the Shichifukujin are sitting in front together.</font>

22
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:32,560
<font size="34">Yes, the previous Shichifukujin and the 9 senbatsu members behind them.</font>

23
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,280
<font size="34">A few of them are already crying.</font>

24
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,280
<font size="34">What kind of tears are they shedding?</font>

25
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:43,080
<font size="34">Probably a mixture of nervousness and emotional complexity.</font>

26
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:48,140
<font size="34">So we're going to connect with the backstage right now.</font>

27
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:51,520
<font size="60">Everyone! Can you all hear me!!?</font>

28
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,780
<font size="34">We can.</font>

29
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:55,480
<font size="34">Must be really nervous right? Your heart must be racing right now.</font>

30
00:01:55,480 --> 00:02:00,180
<font size="34">Let's start the announcement of the second single's senbatsu.</font>

31
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:02,180
<font size="34">The method of announcing the result.</font>

32
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:13,160
<font size="34">The member that was selected first is going to call the next selected member...</font>

33
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:18,380
<font size="34">Because there's no first member yet, so I'm going to announce the first one.</font>

34
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:25,400
<font size="34">The Nogizaka46's Management Team will explain the whole senbatsu.</font>

35
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,680
<font size="34">So let's begin,</font>

36
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,580
<font size="34">there's a lot of envelopes over here.</font>

37
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:35,860
<font size="34">So, the first envelope.</font>

38
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:44,020
<font size="34">Oh! I have goosebump already.</font>

39
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:46,020
<font size="34">The first member,</font>

40
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:54,280
<font size="34">during the previous senbatsu, she cried when she was shocked by the result.</font>

41
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:58,040
<font size="34">After that, she began to work hard as the temporary leader.</font>

42
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,920
<font size="34">She received a lot of good comments, Sakurai Reika.</font>

43
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:04,480
<font size="34">Congratulations, Sakurai!</font>

44
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:10,540
<font size="34">So she came back into the Shichifukujin once again, right?</font>

45
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:15,840
<font size="34">Yes, she was in the first Shichifukujin.</font>

46
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,980
<font size="34">The first member is Sakurai Reika, who dropped out from the Shichifukujin during their debut single.</font>

47
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:25,640
<font size="34">Now, she's back.</font>

48
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,640
<font size="34">Good for you.</font>

49
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:32,580
<font size="34">Honestly, it was very painful for me to drop out from it.</font>

50
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:41,280
<font size="34">You dropped out from the Shichifukujin for the first single.</font>

51
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,160
<font size="34">Please continue to do your best.</font>

52
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,940
<font size="34">-Thank you. -Congratulations.</font>

53
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:49,980
<font size="34">So, there's another important stuff.</font>

54
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:53,660
<font size="34">Inside this is a member's name.</font>

55
00:03:53,660 --> 00:04:05,580
<font size="34">Please announce the next senbatsu member.</font>

56
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:09,160
<font size="34">Although you were restless at the beginning,</font>

57
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:17,360
<font size="34">it must be hard for you to be the center all of a sudden!</font>

58
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:22,780
<font size="34">You did it very well, let's continue to work hard!</font>

59
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,620
<font size="34">Ikoma Rina.</font>

60
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,580
<font size="34">She has shown everyone the responsibility and confidence of a real center!</font>

61
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:36,580
<font size="34">Ikoma Rina entered the Shichifukujin.</font>

62
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,200
<font size="34">Standing here as a center,</font>

63
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:48,160
<font size="34">it was the first time for me to work with confidence.</font>

64
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:55,340
<font size="34">Rather than saying I'm one of Shichifukujin for sure,</font>

65
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:59,320
<font size="34">instead, I think it's the motif of wanting to be in it.</font>

66
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,060
<font size="34">I'll continue to do my best.</font>

67
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:06,820
<font size="34">Yes, very strong indeed. You found your confidence while leading the group.</font>

68
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:09,520
<font size="34">You've changed, Ikoma.</font>

69
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:14,260
<font size="34">Next up the third member, please announce it.</font>

70
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:26,480
<font size="34">She can create a happy atmosphere whenever she goes,</font>

71
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:34,820
<font size="34">she also has very unique ways to prove her own existence.</font>

72
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:36,820
<font size="34">Takayama Kazumi-san!</font>

73
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:42,220
<font size="34">It's Takayama! -Congratulations!</font>

74
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,360
<font size="34">With her very unique's character,</font>

75
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,480
<font size="34">she entered the Shichifukujin!</font>

76
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:54,500
<font size="34">Everyone worked really hard to become the Shichifukujin.</font>

77
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:57,880
<font size="34">So every time I heard that,</font>

78
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:01,560
<font size="34">I can really felt everyone's improvements.</font>

79
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:08,860
<font size="34">Because of that I felt pressured every day.</font>

80
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:16,740
<font size="34">To become a unique idol, I'll not waste this chance.</font>

81
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:18,620
<font size="34">I'll do my best.</font>

82
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:22,400
<font size="34">4 members left for the Shichifukujin.</font>

83
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:37,920
<font size="34">She worked really hard. I'm not joking, I think she's a great member!</font>

84
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:41,340
<font size="34">She has great dance skill.</font>

85
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:42,700
<font size="34">Let's do our best together,</font>

86
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,180

87
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:51,360
<font size="34">Ohh! Nakada's also in the Shichifukujin!</font>

88
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:57,060
<font size="34">With her amazing dancing skill, she came back into Shichifukujin!</font>

89
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:00,120
<font size="34">-Congratulations! -Must be happy, right?</font>

90
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:03,300
<font size="34">I dropped out from the Shichifukujin last time,</font>

91
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:14,060
<font size="34">this time I'll be sure to take this chance and continue to work hard!</font>

92
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:16,540
<font size="34">The next member's name is here.</font>

93
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:23,480
<font size="34">So there'll be two Shichifukujin that's going to drop out.</font>

94
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:34,880
<font size="34">Although she was a dance beginner, she worked really hard.</font>

95
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:40,820
<font size="34">So she can dance well now, she's very happy too!</font>

00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:47,760
<font size="34">Ah! Matsumura!</font>

98
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:55,940
<font size="34">Active as a Shichifukujin, Matsumura continued to be in the Shichifukujin once more!</font>

99
00:07:55,940 --> 00:08:02,140
<font size="34">When I was picked to become the Shichifukujin last time,</font>

100
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:06,360
<font size="34">I thought that my dancing was very bad when I danced in the front row.</font>

101
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:10,700
<font size="34">But I'm still in the front row, is that suitable?</font>

102
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:18,480
<font size="34">So to prove that it's ok for me to take this position,</font>

103
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:23,960
<font size="34">I'll continue to do my best!</font>

104
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:30,120
<font size="34">Next member, please announce it.</font>

105
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:33,080
<font size="34">There are still two Shichifukujin members.</font>

106
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:39,480
<font size="34">Although she did not do very well at the beginning,</font>

107
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:45,640
<font size="34">but she's very hardworking, let's do our best together.</font>

110
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:58,520
<font size="34">A unique existence member, Hashimoto continued to be in the Shichifukujin!</font>

111
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:02,240
<font size="34">Honestly, I did not know what will happen to me this time.</font>

112
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:09,600
<font size="34">I thought about it a lot, and I evaluated myself during the backstage.</font>

113
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:14,940
<font size="34">I'll do my best with everyone for the second single.</font>

114
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:21,240
<font size="34">With that, the last Shichifukujin member in this envelope.</font>

115
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,780
<font size="34">It's the last slot for Shichifukujin!</font>

116
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:29,740
<font size="34">A position that everyone had always looked forward to.</font>

117
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:37,620
<font size="34">She tried to improve herself at all time,</font>

118
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,620
<font size="34">and she never gives up.</font>

119
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:43,760
<font size="34">She had been working hard with a mature heart.</font>

120
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:48,780
<font size="34">Only one of the three previous Shichifukujin will be chosen!</font>

121
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:55,760
<font size="34">Only one slot left, who's it going to be?</font>

122
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,960
<font size="34">She tried to improve herself at all time,</font>

123
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,860
<font size="34">and she never gives up.</font>

124
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:05,180
<font size="34">She had been working hard with a mature heart.</font>

125
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:09,340
<font size="34">Speaking as a female too, I really respect her.</font>

126
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,220
<font size="34">Shiraishi Mai.</font>

127
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:17,680
<font size="34">-So, it's decided. -Yes, it's confirmed.</font>

128
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:22,700
<font size="34">Last Shichifukujin is Shiraishi Mai who has great strength.</font>

129
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:31,240
<font size="34">I'll continue to work hard, and I'll not stop so I can be better.</font>

130
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:35,920
<font size="34">I'll continue to do my best!</font>

131
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,520
<font size="34">Congratulations!</font>

132
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:44,940
<font size="34">So Shiraishi's in the Shichifukujin once more.</font>

133
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:52,920
<font size="34">The last 9 senbatsu members will be announced right now.</font>

134
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:57,000
<font size="34">She worked harder than the others,</font>

135
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:02,340
<font size="34">let's continue to work hard together too.</font>

136
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,020
<font size="34">Inoue Sayuri.</font>

137
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:18,640
<font size="34">Even if she was not in the Shichifukujin, she made it into the senbatsu.</font>

138
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:24,420
<font size="34">During the debut single, I did not make it into Shichifukujin.</font>

139
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:26,820
<font size="34">This time I failed to go in once more,</font>

140
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:31,940
<font size="34">it's probably because I did not work hard enough,</font>

141
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,640
<font size="34">that's why this happened.</font>

142
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:40,580
<font size="34">Well, it's not easy to say you worked hard, but we can only continue to work hard now.</font>

143
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:43,260
<font size="34">-Do your best! -I will.</font>

144
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:44,160
<font size="34">Thank you.</font>

145
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,700
<font size="34">Congratulations! Do your best.</font>

146
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:52,800
<font size="34">Now, the next senbatsu member.</font>

147
00:11:56,780 --> 00:12:04,600
<font size="34">She's very kind and always trying to cheer the other members up.</font>

148
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,820
<font size="34">Thank you for everything you did.</font>

149
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,040
<font size="34">Saito Yuri.</font>

150
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,220
<font size="34">A cheerful member that always make the other happy, Saito Yuri.</font>

151
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:23,700
<font size="34">She entered the senbatsu once more!</font>

152
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:30,020
<font size="34">I actually have no self-confident at all,</font>

153
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:38,140
<font size="34">so I'll work harder than everyone's expectation on me.</font>

154
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:42,400
<font size="34">Only 7 senbatsu members left.</font>

155
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:54,080
<font size="34">Ummm, I learned a lot from her as I did not know how to dance at all,</font>

156
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:59,640
<font size="34">finally, she's in the senbatsu with me so I'm really happy.</font>

157
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,400
<font size="34">Let's continue to work hard together!</font>

158
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,400
<font size="34">Miyazawa Seira.</font>

159
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:10,580
<font size="34">Miyazawa! Sugoi!</font>

160
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:15,440
<font size="34">-It's Miyazawa! -Miyazawa Seira!</font>

161
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,800
<font size="34">She did not make it during last time,</font>

162
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,620
<font size="34">Miyazawa Seira finally makes it into the senbatsu.</font>

163
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:27,760
<font size="34">I did not make it into "Guruguru Curtain's" senbatsu,</font>

164
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:37,240
<font size="34">as an under member, I felt really discouraged.</font>

165
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:42,740
<font size="34">So I'll do my best since I'm in.</font>

166
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:46,500
<font size="34">Well sorry if it's all of a sudden,</font>

167
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:51,020
<font size="34">but the staff is currently calling Miyazawa's mother.</font>

168
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,780
<font size="34">Of course, your mother still has no idea about the senbatsu yet.</font>

169
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:58,140
<font size="34">-Is it her mother? -Yes!</font>

170
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:04,560
<font size="34">About the second single, your daughter made it into the senbatsu.</font>

171
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:07,460
<font size="34">Ah, is that so?</font>

172
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:11,260
<font size="34">That's great Sei-chan, congratulations!</font>

173
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:14,560
<font size="34">That's good, right?</font>

174
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:19,000
<font size="34">Very good, do keep up the good work!</font>

175
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:22,840
<font size="34">Keep encourage yourself.</font>

176
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:27,000
<font size="34">Thank you, sorry to disturb you.</font>

177
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,400
<font size="34">Thank you very much.</font>

178
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:34,600
<font size="34">Last 6 slot left, will there be any first timer just like Miyazawa?</font>

179
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:41,220
<font size="34">It was very hard to take care of both her study and idol career.</font>

180
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:45,040
<font size="34">She always studied hard before the lessons.</font>

181
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,040
<font size="34">I really respect her.</font>

182
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,700
<font size="34">Ichiki Reina.</font>

183
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:56,740
<font size="34">Oh! Ichiki! Congratulations!</font>

184
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:04,820
<font size="34">Ichiki Reina who has to take care of her study too, she made it in again.</font>

185
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:10,020
<font size="34">I'll cherish the opportunity to stand here from today onward.</font>

186
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:14,120
<font size="34">Hardworking and believing myself really do payback! I'll work hard!</font>

187
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:27,840
<font size="34">She continued to smile even if she's not happy.</font>

188
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,960
<font size="34">She loves to eat tasty food!</font>

189
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:36,540
<font size="34">She was really cute when she said that she was on a diet.</font>

190
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,440
<font size="34">From the under and now in the senbatsu. Congratulations!</font>

191
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,680
<font size="34">Let's work hard together!</font>

192
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,960
<font size="34">Hatanaka Seira.</font>

193
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:51,340
<font size="34">-Hatakana! -Hatakana's here! Incredible!</font>

194
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:54,940
<font size="34">She did not make it into the senbatsu last time,</font>

195
00:15:54,940 --> 00:16:00,260
<font size="34">but she's always cheerful, and now she's in the senbatsu.</font>

196
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:01,680
<font size="34">You entered.</font>

197
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,380
<font size="34">How do you feel now?</font>

198
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:08,800
<font size="34">I'm not happy during the last senbatsu because I didn't make it.</font>

199
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:12,580
<font size="34">Even if my family and fans were cheering for me.</font>

200
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:19,320
<font size="34">I'm really sorry. But I made it now and I'll do my best.</font>

201
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:25,540
<font size="34">Actually, Hatakana's mom's on the line now.</font>

202
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,540
<font size="34">Can you hear us?</font>

203
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:28,840
<font size="60">Moshi moshi~~</font>

204
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:32,200
<font size="34">What a hearty voice! Hi, we're Bananaman.</font>

205
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:36,220
<font size="34">The result of the second single senbatsu is here.</font>

206
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:40,680
<font size="34">Your daughter entered the senbatsu.</font>

207
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:45,200
<font size="34">Ah! Thank you very much! I'm really happy!</font>

208
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,200
<font size="34">Congratulations, Seira!</font>

209
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:50,420
<font size="34">-Thank you! -That's great!</font>

210
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:56,200
<font size="34">Don't forget to appreciate the fans and the staffs ok?</font>

211
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:00,480
<font size="34">Do continue to work hard from today onward too!</font>

212
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,540
<font size="34">-I understand. -We're cheering for you!</font>

213
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:07,960
<font size="34">Also please tell Bananaman I'm their hardcore fan!</font>

214
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,500
<font size="34">Thank you!</font>

215
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:13,180
<font size="34">I'll continue to teach her from today onward!</font>

216
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:16,540
<font size="34">Thank you for the hard work! I'm a fan too!</font>

217
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:20,660
<font size="34">Only 4 slots left with the new senbatsu members,</font>

218
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:24,540
<font size="34">will there be more new entries? Who's gonna be the 13th member?</font>

219
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:29,660
<font size="34">She arrived in Tokyo just not long ago, and she felt worried.</font>

220
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:34,520
<font size="34">But she worked really hard, Nishino Nanase.</font>

221
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:50,120
<font size="34">With her fashion sense and her drawing skill, Nishino Nanase entered the senbatsu!</font>

222
00:17:50,640 --> 00:18:03,060
<font size="34">I worked really hard when I entered the previous senbatsu because I wanted to do my best. That's great.</font>

223
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:09,260
<font size="34">Currently, there's still two first single's Shichifukujin left,</font>

224
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:13,680
<font size="34">Ikuta and Hoshino who haven't been called yet.</font>

225
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,300
<font size="34">Only 3 slots left!</font>

226
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:20,960
<font size="34">We smiled together even if we faced hardship,</font>

227
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:26,380
<font size="34">I'm really happy that we entered the senbatsu together.</font>

228
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:31,040
<font size="34">Congratulations, Hoshino Minami.</font>

229
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:41,540
<font size="34">Hoshino! She entered too! Congratulations Hoshino!</font>

230
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:45,560
<font size="34">Hoshino Minami, the center for "Guruguru Curtain."</font>

231
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:50,220
<font size="34">Although she dropped out from the Shichifukujin, she still entered the senbatsu.</font>

232
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:57,520
<font size="34">I was happy when I was in the Shichifukujin, but I also had a lot of pressure.</font>

233
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:03,260
<font size="34">But I'm still happy that I entered the senbatsu.</font>

234
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,800
<font size="34">I'll continue to do my best!</font>

235
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,960
<font size="34">The 16th senbatsu slot for the second single.</font>

236
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,780
<font size="34">There are still 4 members that were in the first senbatsu.</font>

237
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:15,320
<font size="34">But there are only 2 slots left, who is it going to be?</font>

238
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:22,740
<font size="34">She worked really hard and taught me a lot.</font>

239
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:27,440
<font size="34">She worked hard as a Shichifukujin too, and I want to say thank you.</font>

240
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,160
<font size="34">Let's work hard together!</font>

241
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,980
<font size="34">Ikuta Erika.</font>

242
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:37,580
<font size="34">Ikuta. She was only mentioned until now.</font>

243
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:41,900
<font size="34">One of the center previously, 16 years old Ikuta Erika.</font>

244
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:47,080
<font size="34">As a former Shichifukujin, she entered the senbatsu.</font>

245
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,800
<font size="34">So you dropped out from the Shichifukujin this time.</font>

246
00:19:52,000 --> 00:20:00,680
<font size="34">I'm very sad. Very sad.</font>

247
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:08,020
<font size="34">Do work hard to go back into the Shichifukujin.</font>

248
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:12,520
<font size="34">Congratulations!</font>

249
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:19,680
<font size="34">-Now, the last slot. -The Last slot!</font>

250
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:26,520
<font size="34">Only one slot left for the senbatsu, will it be a new entry or not?</font>

251
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:35,020
<font size="34">Only one slot left for the senbatsu, will it be a new entry or not?</font>

252
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:42,620
<font size="34">She took care of me like a big sister.</font>

253
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:49,100
<font size="34">She's kind and nice to talk to.</font>

254
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,720
<font size="34">She supported everyone from the start.</font>

255
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:56,600
<font size="34">Thank you very much our eldest member,</font>

256
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,960
<font size="34">Iwase Yumiko.</font>

257
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,200
<font size="34">Iwase's here!</font>

258
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,060
<font size="34">The last to enter is the eldest member, Iwase Yumiko.</font>

259
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:19,260

260
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,680
<font size="34">Congratulations!</font>

261
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:30,000
<font size="34">I worked really hard for the next senbatsu with the other members,</font>

262
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,700
<font size="34">everyone worked really hard.</font>

263
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:41,900
<font size="34">I was really happy when my name was mentioned.</font>

264
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:45,980
<font size="34">That's great.</font>

265
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:49,960
<font size="34">And someone's on the phone now.</font>

266
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,960

267
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:54,400
<font size="34">-Ummm, ma'am. -You're joking right!?</font>

268
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,300
<font size="34">We're recording a show right now,</font>

269

<font size="34">Your mother knew you worked really hard.</font>

274
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,700
<font size="34">-Yes. -That's good.</font>

275
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:37,380
