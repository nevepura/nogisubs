00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,340
Just like Mirin and Kirin, KarinÜ

48
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:13,410

00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:15,610

Karin Ü

57
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:35,030
Must be Karinüv... In our whole life
we always think it's Karinüv.

58
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:37,930
- Your parents read it like that, too?

Yes, but in hospital they called me Karinüv

61
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,800
That's the normal one, right?

62
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:47,010
- KarinÜ is weird.

00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:49,280
- But you're Karinüv right?
- KarinÜ

64
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,340

... Chiba.

102
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,440
This is Hokkaido.

103
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,840
- How could she know? also it's different from the original.
- It's in the question.
- Oh, in the question?

104
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:29,680

109
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:38,920
Right!

110
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:41,290
- Awesome..
- Yeah.

111
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:46,460
- Is there any particular form of Okayama? I don't know.
- Isn't it looks like Tochigi?

112
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:50,200
Yeah, but Tochigi is a bit flat.

113
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:53,730
- A bit flat? Which part?
- Here.

114
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:55,770
- So this part is more sharp ,right??
- Yeah right.

115
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,140
Because it located in the seaside.

116
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:01,770
Next 2nd gen Member is Itou Junna.

117
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:07,210
Her hobby is.. groping someoone.
Hey you can arrested by the police!

118
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:10,320
Why groping?

119
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:13,320
It's because... Girls are smooth and soft, right?

120
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,490
- Yeah right!
- I know right!

121
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:18,720
But isn't that a man's feeling?

122
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,930
So you like soft things?

123
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:22,530
I'd rather hug than groping, actually.

124
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,460
Feels good, huh?

125
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:27,030
Everyone wants to do it...
Especially old man.

00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:29,130

Ripping a magazine? Can yo do it?

172
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:40,170

173
00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:43,440
Ok, please rip it.

174
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:55,710
Awesome!

175
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,650
Cool!

176
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:03,020
What's this? Since when you can do that?

177
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:06,860
In the audition, there are parts that require you
to show your skill.

178
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:10,600
And then my father told me to do that.

179
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,730
Next 2nd gen is Sasaki Kotoko.

180
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:20,710
- Skills, Sleep anywhere.
- Anywhere ?

181
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:23,810
Even in the muddy place?

182
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:26,110
Umm.. yeah as long as there is a bed.

183
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,550
Favourite food, Mentsuyu (soup/sauce)

184
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:33,220
This is also....

185
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:35,590
From any kinds of food!?

186
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,990
Any kinds!?

187
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:41,930
I like to drink mentsuyu that has been diluted with water.

188
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:48,800
That's why... I'm talking about compare it to Chuutoro.
It's Mentsuyu right? Mentsuyu!

189
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,640
Yes!

190
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:57,880
Ok, in belt conveyor, if there is Ootoro, Uni,
meat, konpeitou, mentsuyu...

191
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:00,110
- You'll take mentsuyu?
- Yes, mentsuyu.

192
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:02,610
- Really?
- Yes.
- Why the food list is like that?

193
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:06,220
- Yeah, it's this kind of restaurant!
- It's the same as the previous restaurant.

194
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:09,020
Do you like to draw?

195
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:10,160
Yes...

196
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,360
What did you usually draw?

197
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,890
I don't draw.

198
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:16,060
A confusing answer.

199
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:19,460
I like to picture it in my mind.

200
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:21,100
What is it?

201
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:22,330
A Line...

202
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:24,370
- Line?
- Line?

203
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:27,670
What the hell are you saying?

204
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:34,980
Next, let's check out the profile of Shin'uchi Mai.

205
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:39,720
Oh, her skill is cool.
No surprise, she's the oldest.

00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:43,960
- Can tell the name of all Tokyo Metro colors (Underground Train).

207
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:52,400
The sign, right? For the underground train.
Ok, here's the document.

208
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:56,270
- So, you wanna guess the name or colors?

209
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:59,170
- Oh, both?
- Colors and track?

00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:01,570

00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:25,230
Hahaha, so there is also dark blue.

00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,910
- Ah, You like it?

228
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:46,820
Umm.. Colors and Line, im not
really interested with the train, actually.

229
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:50,520
It's on the top, right? (route map).

230
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,220
I always see it.

231
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:54,860

So far there's still no member who like train...

234
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:01,470
Not train, i like Metro.

235
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:09,540
Coming up, why is Bananaman angry?

236
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:15,580
Next 2nd gen member is Suzuki Ayane.

237
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:17,380
From Akita?

238
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:18,250
Yes, Akita

239
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:20,050
- Same with Ikoma.
- I see.

240
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:22,850
- You're Ikoma's junior.
- Born in the same place.

241
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:26,760
Things she love.. All kinds of Airplane.

242
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,060
No...

243
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:30,960
- Eh, No?
- NOOO, not wrong, but...

244
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:33,330
- Wrong?
- Not Wrong.

245
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:35,770
Wrong!?

246
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:46,480
At the announcement day, from Akita to Tokyo, Haneda.
At first i was going to get on Boeing 787 but it's cancelled.

247
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:51,980
Finally take off.. I like Airbus than Boeing.

248
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,820
Really like it!

249
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:57,520
Why don't you tell from the start?

250
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,990
You have one favourite Airplane, right?

251
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:01,830
Not all kinds of Airplane.

252
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:04,430
- Yes!
- What type of Airbus?

253
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:06,870
Airbus A380, like this.

254
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:09,400
What you just did?

255
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,570
- Because it's big.
- Which part do you like?

256
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:18,540
Because gooo and waaa, and then hihihi.

257
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:21,280
What the hell are you doing?

258
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,550
- Why do you like it?
- I don't know.

259
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:30,060
There must be a reason.

260
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:37,800
If you don't know anything,
how could you know about that Airbus type.

261
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:41,730
Why do you like A380? Must be a reason.

262
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:44,140
No it's just.. "Pon"
I suddenly like it.

263
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:45,270
No way!

264
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:51,680
There must be something.
Like when you see it fly or whatever.

265
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,640
Nothing!

266
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,250
This damn kid!

267
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:58,220
Akita... since in Tokyo,
You have a red on you.

268
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:04,260
- Yes...
- Hey, Ikoma also got it.
- Must be the air, water..

269
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,160
People... You don't like it.

270
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,260
The water is not good.

271
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:09,060
Ikoma said that too.

272
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:11,430
But she has changed.

273
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:19,910
Next, let's check out the profile of Terada Ranze.

274
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:21,840
- Terada Ranze.
- Yes.

275
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:24,840
- Ranze?!
- Unique name, cool.

276
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:29,950
- What's this.. her weakness is stupid.
- It's not really a weakness.

277
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:32,020
Is there any story about your stupidity?

278
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:37,620
Lately, in science lesson,
there is a formula calculation.

279
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:45,860
My teacher said, the fromula is right,
but the multiplication is wrong, so my answer is wrong.

280
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:46,870
You're bad in multiplication?

281
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:50,500
Multiplication and others... All subjects.

282
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,840
But there are worse person, right?

283
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:57,240
Like the one who can't tell the difference
between teacher and student.

284
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:01,980
- I did not come to that.
- Then it's not really a weakness...

285
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:03,720
Your small, eh?

286
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:06,380
- 155 cm
- Oh, 155cm?

287
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:07,350
Ah, yes.

288
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:08,650
Her face is tiny.

289
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:12,120
- But we also have...
- Saitou Asuka.

290
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,290
Have you met Saitou Asuka?

291
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:16,190
Yes i have.

292
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:19,870
- Her face is tiny, right?
- Yes.

293
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:21,530
But you also looks like ikuta...

294
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:23,500
Err... Lately...

295
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:24,740
Which one is better?

296
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:27,470
No need to answer.

297
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:34,880
Next, profile of Nishikawa Nanami.

298
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:37,680
Nishikawa, i saw you on the news.

299
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,890
- So you're an AKB48 ex-member.
- Yes.

300
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:42,220
Ex-kenkyuusei, right?

301
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:49,330
But it's only for a very short time.
I can't count that as an ex...

302
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:51,860
I see... Let's forget that from now on.

303
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:57,600
- Oh! You went to the same junior high school
with Akimoto Manatsu, same year!
- Yes, right.

304
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:02,010
- Even in the same extracurricular.
- Really? What?

305
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:02,870
Cooking club.

306
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:04,710
You can cook?

307
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:10,020
But, when i saw nogidoko, and saw
Manatsu-senpai cooking...

308
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:12,950
Right, from the same year, now become a senpai.

309
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:15,150
- Yeah right.
- Complicated.

310
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:16,820
You're friends, right?

311
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:18,620
- Yeah, we're friends.
- This is interesting!

312
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:20,730
So you talked to each other at school?

313
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:22,790
Of course, we're on the same club.

314
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:23,900
Like what?

315
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:26,830
- Like Manaccha~n
- Like that, right?

316
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:30,940

Now, ah excuse me Akimoto senpai...

318

Next, profile of Hori Miona.

319
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:45,350
Favourite food... Meat.

320
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:48,720
She wrote the best 3.

321
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,960
No. 3 Salt Tongue (TanShio),

322
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:53,120
No. 2 Kakuteki (Turnip Kimchi)

323
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,390
Kakuteki?!

324
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:57,500
Kakuteki is not meat.

325
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:00,400
But this... BBQ Restaurant, right?

326
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:03,740
No. 1 Senmai Sashi (Sashimi)

327
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:05,440
That's plain!

328
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,310
That's so Plain!

329
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:10,480
How about Karubi and Harami (Meat name) ?

330
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:14,550
I still prefer the Senmai.

331
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:15,510
Plain, right?

332
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:22,490
It's senmai plus kakuteki and tanshio...
Isn't that finished already? After that is BBQ.

333
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:24,220
- Ah, i repeat it again.
- This?
- Yes.

334
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:26,460
- Why?
- It's so plain. Why do you like it?

335
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:31,000
I like the crispy flavour of senmai sashi.

336
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,830
Ah, crispy....

337
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:36,130
And what do you drink?

338
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:37,940
Umm... Tea.

339
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:41,040
Eat senmai sashi and drink tea. Awesome!

340
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:43,480
Her skill is.. Flash Blink.

341
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:43,910
Yes.

342
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:48,580
- Can you show it?
- I wanna see it.

343
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:50,520
Ok, Start!

344
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:53,690
Fast!

345
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:57,320
At first her face is so serious but it slowly relaxed.

346
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:00,660
Is there anyone who can do it too?

347
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:04,330
- Yamazaki.
- Come on Yamazaki!

348
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:10,940
Wait, Hori, do it again.

349
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:14,210
Ah, she's faster.

350
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:17,180
Hori is faster and smooth.

351
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:22,510
After this, Akimoto the Legend will appear again!

352
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:29,020
Next 2nd gen is Yada Risako

353
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:30,890
Yada!

354
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:34,560
- No way!
- You went to same Highschool with Akimoto?

355
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,960
Who is Akimoto actually?

356
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,630
Really! Same Highschool?

357
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:41,270
1 Year above.

358
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:43,470
- Ah, you're her junior?
- Yes.

359
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:46,810
But really, there are 3 people from there.

360
00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:48,910
Yeah, Akimoto as the center.

361
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:50,940
What the hell is this...

362
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:54,350
- Is Akimoto cute at that time?
- Yes, really cute.

363
00:18:54,350 --> 00:19:03,690
Since she was accepted, when all the junior including me
saw her at the station, We always like, "Manatsu-san!"

364
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:06,160
I see, since she was in Nogizaka46 right?

365
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,290
Great.. so if they saw her at the station,
Look it's Manatsu-san!

366
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:12,460
You saw her in the waterfall episode?

367
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:14,800
- You saw it?
- Yes.

368
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:17,170
Manatsu-san.

369
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:20,410
- Also, the Skydiving. You saw it?
- Yes.

370
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:25,280
Hahaha, Manatsu-san... like Degawa-san.

00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:31,750
Next 2nd gen is Yamazaki Rena.

372
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,450
Wait a second...

00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:37,190
- Skills, Chaplin's speech.
- Yes.

374
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:39,460
What is that? Chaplin's speech.

375
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:47,370
I was in english club for one year in junior high.
There was a contest so i memorize it.

376
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:49,130
Now it become my skills.

377
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:51,000

- Yes i can.

378
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,040
- Please do it.
- Sure.

379
00:19:52,040 --> 00:20:16,060
Yes, start now!

380
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:18,800
- This is... Cool!
- Awesome!

381
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,430
What did you just say?

382
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:22,100
I don't know.

383
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,800
Eeee... Really?

384
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,970
I forgot...

385
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:28,710
When you started talking in english
Your face was like.. what's that?

386
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,180
Seems like you're go deep into it?

387
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:32,240
Yes.

388
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:37,520
Next, Yonetoku Kyoka's profile.

389
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:41,290
Oh, you're so good at swimming,
even participated in junior olympics?

390
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:43,290
Yes, right.

391
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:45,560
Olympics level?!

392
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,930

393
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:49,090
- Yes.

394
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:51,000
Favourite food.

395
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,760
Udon and Mochi.

396
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:55,400
Why do you like udon?

397
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:58,900
I like the chewy taste from the noodles.

398
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:02,810
Your dream is, eating noodles while
riding the adrenaline rush.

399
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,880
Why is that?

400
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,050
Usually we eat udon while relaxing.

401
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:09,380
Why?

402
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:16,120
- I think it's exciting to do two things that we like at the same time.
- Oh, you like adrenaline rush?

403
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,360
I love it!

404
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:22,690
No no no, it's better to eat after you ride it.

405
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:24,630
No, i want to do it at the same time.

406
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:25,930
With hot soup?

407
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:28,500
No, only the noodles.

408
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:31,370
Without the sauce?

409
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:32,540
Only noodles.

410
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:36,640
If you get the chance, how about the sauce?

411
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,580
How?

412
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:39,810
But... It will spill to my face...

413
00:21:39,810 --> 00:21:44,280
- Yeah, that's it.
- That's the problem.

414
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:47,090
You like mochi too. Tell us about it.

415
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:51,760
I like mochi poured with shouyu.

416
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,730
How much can you eat?

417
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:56,760
In new year's eve, in 1 day i can eat about...

418
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,460

419

Awesome...

424
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,420
Only two years different from my child. Wow.

425
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,650

- Yeah.

426
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:24,460
- You look so mature.
- Everyone said so.

427
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:26,160
Everyone said so, right?

428
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:29,030
Because you're so calm?

429
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:32,360
- Oh, her hobby...
- Touching people's cheek.

430
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:34,200
What does it mean?

431
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:37,770
Umm, i have my own rank...

432
00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:38,670

Mochi water.

Water mochi for the softest, mochi for the hardest and elastic.
And i love touching it to observe.

- How about Shitara?

454
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:41,970
