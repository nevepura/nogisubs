00:00:01,450 --> 00:00:05,280
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Nogizaka46's 8th single campaign in Macau</font>

2
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:09,390
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">The best part of this trip will be a bungee jump!</font>

3
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:13,660
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Here we will also discover things about the member's human nature</font>

4
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:19,330
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">And finally, we go to Macau Tower</font>

5
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:46,260
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">The campaign for the 8th single, 
Kidzuitara Kataomoi, will take place in Macau</font>

6
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:55,200
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">In this campaign, the member with the worst luck will jump so that the single becomes a hit</font>

7
00:00:56,740 --> 00:01:01,270
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Continuing from last time, the member with the lowest score is Ikuta</font>

8
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:04,880
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Then, the next place to go to is...</font>

9
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:08,880
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Everyone, you said you're hungry, right?</font>

10
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:10,780
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Let's get some food</font>

11
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:17,660
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Here's a Portugal restaurant called "Busshourou"</font>

12
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:23,330
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">This is a restaurant specialized in Portuguese food in Macau</font>

13
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,400
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">But of course even here..</font>

14
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:29,400
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Here we go, lucky card draw time</font>

15
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,940
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">The members ranked first to fourth will get to eat delicious food</font>

16
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,880
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Four of them get to eat the delicious food</font>

17
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,310
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">That's pretty lucky</font>

18
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:44,850
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">And for the rest, you get something else</font>

19
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,150
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Scary</font>

20
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:54,130
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Who will get to eat the delicious Portuguese food? The result is...</font>

21
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:03,870
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Ikoma has 7, first place. Takayama has 6, second place</font>

22
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:10,180
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">The three that don't get the delicious food are Nishino, Matsumura, and Wada</font>

23
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:12,780
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">What will they get?</font>

24
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:20,390
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">From now on, there will be food coming out. For the three of you, the person with the highest rank will have to choose whether to eat the meal or pass it on.</font>

25
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:28,560
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Now Macau meals will be served one by one in front of them</font>

26
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:36,600
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">And starting from the highest rank they must choose to eat or not to eat that meal</font>

27
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:40,610
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Takayama, there's something behind your head, is it okay?</font>

28
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:41,810
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Kazumin's head bumped into it</font>

29
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:45,180
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">You bumped into it, right? Minus 5 Macau.</font>

30
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:50,250
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Well, here's the first dish</font>

31
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:55,150
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Here it comes</font>

32
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:56,860
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">This is...</font>

33
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:59,290
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">We don't know yet
- We'll tell you later</font>

34
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:01,130
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">But it looks delicious
 - We can see the shape</font>

35
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:02,390
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">You're right</font>

36
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,370
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Well, I'll eat it</font>

37
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:08,830
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">As expected from the new center</font>

38
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,600
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Which part will you eat?
- Maybe this part</font>

39
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,470
<font face="Segoe UI Semibold" size="46">Delicious piece</font>

40
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:16,600
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Go for this part</font>

41
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,600
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">It hurts</font>

42
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,600
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50"></font>

43
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:24,520
<font face="Segoe UI Semibold" size="46">Himura's other self?</font>

44
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,390
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Get ready</font>

45
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:28,320
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">You get it, right?</font>

46
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,620
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">It becomes like that</font>

47
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,120
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Go ahead</font>

48
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,690
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50"></font>

49
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,170
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">That was shocking!</font>

50
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:41,970
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">I'm surprised, wow scary</font>

51
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,240
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">So funny, please watch it one more time</font>

52
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:01,090
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Hilarious!</font>

53
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:02,390
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">I thought it was a ghost</font>

54
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,160
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">We're sorry. Please eat it</font>

55
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:14,500
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Ah, but... it tastes like regular meat</font>

56
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,500
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Well, it is edible after all</font>

57
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:21,970
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Now that Nishino has finished eating, what are these exactly?</font>

58
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:27,310
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Well, these are whole heads of a roasted pig and duck</font>

59
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:29,680
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Pig and duck</font>

60
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,280
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Hello I'm pig
- I'm duck</font>

61
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,280
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Together we're pig and duck</font>

62
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:37,460
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Next, the meal for Matsumura</font>

63
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:42,230
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Impossible
- Nanamin will like this</font>

64
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:45,000
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">It's noodles
- No, no, impossible</font>

65
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:49,200
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Why? It's ramen</font>

66
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,170
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">It's okay. You can pass it on, but you'd have to eat the last meal</font>

67
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:56,170
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">What should I do? Impossible</font>

68
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:57,440
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">But this is ramen</font>

69
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,110
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Can I pass this?</font>

70
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:00,580
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">It's alright</font>

71
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:02,980
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Then, I pass
- No, no</font>

72
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:04,880
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Wada doesn't have any choice but to receive it</font>

73
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:04,980
<font face="Segoe UI Semibold" size="46">No Choice</font>

74
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:07,290
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Yes, she doesn't have choice</font>

75
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:11,560
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Wada has to eat this</font>

76
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:14,460
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">It looks like real food</font>

77
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,660
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Looks delicious</font>

78
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:20,900
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">How is it?</font>

79
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,430
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Really delicious!</font>

80
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:25,270
<font face="Segoe UI Semibold" size="46">Huge Grin</font>

81
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:28,170
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Why did you turn it down, Matsumura?</font>

82
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:30,170
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Because of the toppings</font>

83
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:33,180
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">The toppings for the noodles</font>

84
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:35,180
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Try it</font>

85
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:38,420
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Wow you ate it all in one bite</font>

86
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:41,820
<font face="Segoe UI Semibold" size="46"></font>

87
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:44,590
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">You are the one bite type when eating ramen, right?</font>

88
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,790
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Really delicious</font>

89
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:50,130
<font face="Segoe UI Semibold" size="46"></font>

90
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:51,500
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Super delicious?</font>

91
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,800
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Like a liver taste</font>

92
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,470
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50"></font>

93
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,340
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">It's great! It's like you got it right</font>

94
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:05,540
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">So, what is it?
- This is pig's brain ramen</font>

95
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:07,810
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Eeh~!?</font>

96
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:10,650
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Why are you looking at this?</font>

97
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:14,390
<font face="Segoe UI Semibold" size="46">Owner of the brain?</font>

98
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:15,890
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Maybe it was his brain</font>

99
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,560
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Then, what will Matsumura have to eat?</font>

100
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:23,960
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Please be normal, please be normal</font>

101
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,960
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Matsumura, please look at it</font>

102
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:29,230
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">What is that?</font>

103
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:35,510
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50"></font>

104
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:43,380
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">You can't pass anymore. Matsumura, this is your dinner</font>

105
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:51,220
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">I think I know what this is</font>

106
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:52,020
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50"></font>

107
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:54,560
<font face="Segoe UI Semibold" size="46"></font>

108
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,130
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">So that's it</font>

109
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:00,030
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Good, good</font>

110
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:03,900
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Same as this</font>

111
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:10,180
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Bite it</font>

112
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,680
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Ouch, ouch</font>

113
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:16,450
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">How's the taste?</font>

114
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:17,680
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">No taste</font>

115
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,120
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">No way</font>

116
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:23,820
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">I ate it</font>

117
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:27,260
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">This is... well, what do you think?</font>

118
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:28,590
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">What is it?</font>

119
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:30,000
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Human?</font>

120
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:35,000
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Ah, chicken. A chicken's feet</font>

121
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:36,870
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Is this real!?</font>

122
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:40,010
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Wada, that was a good comment</font>

123
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:41,910
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Is this real?</font>

124
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:43,780
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Is this frozen?</font>

125
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:46,910
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Similar with "Take me skiing"</font>

126
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:50,250
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">So plus 5 points for you</font>

127
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:53,690
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">5 Macau</font>

128
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:57,420
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Next, time for these four to eat</font>

129
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:01,460
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">These are grilled prawns</font>

130
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:05,130
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Then, African chicken</font>

131
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:09,770
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">And Curry lobster. Enjoy</font>

132
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:11,440
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Ikuta, how's the shrimp?</font>

133
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,870
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">The taste is really strong</font>

134
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:16,980
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">It has a great flavor, really tasty</font>

135
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:18,980
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Looks tasty</font>

136
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:20,980
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Curry lobster</font>

137
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:30,790
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">This is very delicious, also the spiciness is perfect</font>

138
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:32,790
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Really good</font>

139
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:34,190
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Really delicious</font>

140
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:35,690
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Is the African chicken good?</font>

141
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:37,690
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">What kind of taste?</font>

142
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:39,800
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">What is this?</font>

143
00:08:43,170 --> 00:08:44,970
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">-1 Macau</font>

144
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:48,870
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50"></font>

145
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:54,350
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Maybe this chicken has been simmered, the taste has been absorbed into it</font>

146
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:56,180
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">And it's soft</font>

147
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:59,020
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">So what kind of taste? -1 Macau</font>

148
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:01,020
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">We asked for the taste</font>

149
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:04,890
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Ikuta, can you describe what African chicken tastes like?</font>

150
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:10,500
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">When it first came in my mouth, it tasted like something from a foreign country</font>

151
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:13,970
<font face="Segoe UI Semibold" size="46">Of course it did</font>

152
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:20,010
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">But the more I chew it, it becomes more and more like my own home country</font>

153
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,740
<font face="Segoe UI Semibold" size="46">Tastes like home?</font>

154
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:25,040
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Really? Even though it's African?</font>

155
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,280
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">German</font>

156
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,080
<font face="Segoe UI Semibold" size="46">Nonsense</font>

157
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,510
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">What is up with that?</font>

158
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:33,450
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Now that dinner has ended, the first day of recording the Macau tour is done</font>

159
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:38,290
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">We moved using different buses than the members</font>

160
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:42,690
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">At that time, only Wada waved her hands at us</font>

161
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:46,160
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Well, for Wada, +5 Macau</font>

162
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:48,370
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">We did it too</font>

163
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:55,240
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">But, before that, our bus was side by side, some of you maybe waved to us</font>

164
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:59,140
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">But, Takayama was sat at the back</font>

165
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:02,750
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">She waved her hand but suddenly bird shit landed there nicely</font>

166
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:05,620
<font face="Segoe UI Semibold" size="46">Senseless woman</font>

167
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:09,590
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Even if there was a window, Takayama -3 Macau</font>

168
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:16,800
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Just now in front of her there was some dirty looking rubbish</font>

169
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:26,170
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Hashimoto and Ikuta gave no reaction</font>

170
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:30,210
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">-10 Macau</font>

171
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:32,210
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">No way</font>

172
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:34,850
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">If you don't act more lively...</font>

173
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:38,050
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">We should make this more exciting</font>

174
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:39,250
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Right, Nishino?</font>

175
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:40,120
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">YES!</font>

176
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,620
<font face="Segoe UI Semibold" size="46">Full of spirit!</font>

177
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:46,220
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">We've never heard Nishino answer loudly like that before</font>

178
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:47,760
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">This is the first time
- Right, Nishino?</font>

179
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,730
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">YES!</font>

180
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:51,230
<font face="Segoe UI Semibold" size="46">Abrupt power</font>

181
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:53,470
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Really cute</font>

182
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:55,770
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Right, Hashimoto?
- YES!</font>

183
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:58,040
<font face="Segoe UI Semibold" size="46">Ventriloquist</font>

184
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,740
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Good, good</font>

185
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:04,610
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Next, the member's true nature is revealed</font>

186
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:10,780
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">The recording has ended. The members are resting in the hotel to prepare for tomorrow</font>

187
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,650
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">There...</font>

188
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:17,690
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Nogizaka's true nature check</font>

189
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:22,260
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">We've arrived at the hotel</font>

190
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:29,570
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Staff will call them in from each of their rooms for to prepare for tomorrow's recording</font>

191
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:38,780
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">The truth is they will come to this room. 
We will check who is the fastest one to come</font>

192
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:44,920
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">They will get points according to their order of arrival</font>

193
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:49,090
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Is it alright if they come with no make up?</font>

194
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,090
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">They will hate it</font>

195
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:53,090
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Make up is not for men?</font>

196
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:56,130
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">No, they are girls</font>

197
00:11:56,130 --> 00:11:58,130
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">That's why I've prepared this</font>

198
00:11:58,130 --> 00:11:59,400
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Ikoma</font>

199
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:02,330
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">If they don't want to show their face, they can use it like this</font>

200
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:08,910
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">The members have been called. Who will be the first member to arrive?</font>

201
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:11,310
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">How about this?</font>

202
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:13,710
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">The others are two girls in one room</font>

203
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:15,710
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50"></font>

204
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:17,710
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Is there a possibility of someone not coming?</font>

205
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:19,380
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">No</font>

206
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:22,890
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Everyone must come, we told them we're having a meeting</font>

207
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:26,060
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">While they are talking...</font>

208
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:28,860
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">They've arrived</font>

209
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,030
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Thank you</font>

210
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:38,740
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Stop it! Wait... No</font>

211
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:42,370
<font face="Segoe UI Semibold" size="46">Panic</font>

212
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:43,640
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Is it Ikoma?</font>

213
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:51,720
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Come here!</font>

214
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,720
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Hurry! 
- You're first. 7 points</font>

215
00:12:53,720 --> 00:13:03,660
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Come here, they're arriving</font>

217
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:09,970
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Oh, you're here. Hashimoto, you're second, so 6 points.</font>

218
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:14,540
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Hashimoto is unexpectedly quick</font>

219
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,580
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Please gather here</font>

220
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:21,150
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Therefore, Ikoma is first and Hashimoto is second</font>

221
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:24,250
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">They came right after being called, what a wonderful attitude</font>

222
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:27,350
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Naa-chan was taking a bath!</font>

223
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:31,490
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Really? So that is her fate</font>

224
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:33,190
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">You got a room alone</font>

225
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,360
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Yes, right</font>

226
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,130
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Selfish</font>

227
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,130
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">You're like an actress</font>

228
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:40,870
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">No</font>

229
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:42,170
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">That's what actresses get, right?</font>

230
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:46,770
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Seems like I'm the only one who is okay to stay alone</font>

231
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:52,410
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">What excellent members of Nogizaka, but...</font>

232
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:55,880
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">It's pretty late</font>

233
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:56,110
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">What a shock. We starting to doubting their personality</font>

234
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:58,850
<font face="Segoe UI Semibold" size="46">Five minutes past</font>

235
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:00,020
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">What is this?</font>

236
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:01,790
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">What do you mean?</font>

237
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:03,760
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Like how serious they do their job</font>

238
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,720
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Like to come as soon as they're told</font>

239
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:07,760
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">We also like to take a bubble bath</font>

240
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:08,930
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Normal bath is alright</font>

241
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:12,100

242
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:14,770
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">I'm tired</font>

243
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,470
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Murmuring is prohibited</font>

244
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:19,940
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Minus 5 macau</font>

245
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:22,510
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">What are you doing?</font>

246
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,310
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Everyone was called at the same time?
- Yes</font>

247
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:32,050
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Isn't this late?
- It's late.</font>

248
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:37,660
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">We've waited long enough, staff will call all of them once again</font>

249
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:46,730
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Thanks for your hard work. Excuse me for calling you again. But, can you come here right now?</font>

250
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,970
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Thank you, we're counting on you</font>

251
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:55,610
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">This is... I looked at these faces one by one</font>

252
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:56,140
<font face="Segoe UI Semibold" size="46">Members < AD's shirt</font>

253
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:57,310
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">It's not important!</font>

254
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,010
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">How about the call?</font>

255
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:00,980
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">How was it?</font>

256
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:03,380
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">She asked if there was a photo session</font>

257
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:04,980
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">She asked that?</font>

258
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:06,590
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">That's right~</font>

259
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:08,590
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Photo session!</font>

260
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,490
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">And then...</font>

261
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:14,990
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Someone's coming</font>

262
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:27,270
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Whaat~?</font>

263
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:28,770
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">You're third</font>

264
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:30,380
<font face="Segoe UI Semibold" size="46">Sudden rank announcement</font>

265
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:31,310
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">You're late!</font>

266
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:33,610
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">It's not like that, a lot of things happened</font>

267
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:39,150
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Matsumura is third, but it's past 13 minutes after the first call was made</font>

268
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:41,750
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Iku-chan is taking a bath</font>

269
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,750
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">She knows about the call?</font>

270
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:44,860
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">I've told her</font>

271
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:48,260
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">She was with me when I picked up</font>

272
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,700
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">And because I got the second call... I left her</font>

273
00:15:53,540 --> 00:16:00,320
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">- They're late
- What happening over here in room 406?</font>

274
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,440
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">They're late...</font>

275
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,080
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">This is strange</font>

276
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:11,160
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">From the first call... I think maybe we should change their point with this situation</font>

277
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,140
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Yes</font>

278
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:21,080
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Thanks for your hard work</font>

279
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:23,900
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Thank you... Eh! Wait!</font>

280
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:27,360
<font face="Segoe UI Semibold" size="46">No Make-up</font>

281
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,880
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">No way~ it's a joke, right?</font>

282
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,880
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">No makeup, no makeup</font>

283
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:36,300
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Alright, Takayama and Maaya</font>

284
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:41,320
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Fourth are Takayama and Wada who arrived at the same time</font>

285
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:44,280
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">They've arrived 18 minutes after the first call</font>

286
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:45,680
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">You're late</font>

287
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,200
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">I'm sorry</font>

288
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:50,940
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">When I got the call, I was bare naked</font>

289
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,180
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Well...</font>

290
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:54,940
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Plus 5 Macau</font>

291
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:57,260
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Why!? What are those points for?</font>

292
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,260
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Why do you give 5 points for being naked</font>

293
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,320
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Maaya..</font>

294
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,660
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">I can't open my eyes</font>

295
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:03,340
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Were you sleeping?
- Yes</font>

296
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:05,320
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Bathrobe is good</font>

297
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:07,660
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">I'm not wearing anything under this</font>

298
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:08,660
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Eh!?</font>

299
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:11,280
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">I'm not even wearing a bra</font>

300
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,960
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">You're not wearing a T-shirt?</font>

301
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,520
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Plus 5 Macau</font>

302
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:18,460
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Takayama-san, you could be number one with this</font>

303
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:19,440
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">No, no.</font>

304
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,640
<font face="Segoe UI Semibold" size="46">Hiding</font>

305
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,520
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Okay, Ikuchan, come over here please</font>

306
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,480
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">What is this?</font>

307
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:42,420
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">We're in the middle of a true nature check</font>

308
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,200
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Ikutadon, right?</font>

309
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:48,820
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Pajama</font>

310
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:50,520
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Go ahead</font>

311
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,000
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">What is this?</font>

312
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:56,160
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Ikuchan sleeps covered with music</font>

313
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,760
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">No way, no way</font>

314
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:03,420
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Eh, what is this? This is bad.</font>

315
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:07,240
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Sixth is Ikuta who shows up wearing pajamas</font>

316
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,660
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">She's twenty minutes late</font>

317
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,000
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Ikuta, what's up with that pajama?</font>

318
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,360
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">This is a pajama, right?</font>

319
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:17,780
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">I always wear this pajama in every sleepover to feel comfortable</font>

320
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:22,480
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Full of instruments</font>

321
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,960
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Those are guitars</font>

322
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:25,960
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Very cute</font>

323
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:29,280
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">With this pajama...</font>

324
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,280
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Ikuta gets plus 5 Macau</font>

325
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,060
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Yes! Great</font>

326
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:34,980
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">It's like coming late is good too</font>

327
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,980
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">No, no. The first one is the winner</font>

328
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:38,980
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">All that's left is Nishino</font>

329
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:45,500
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">But she's not coming as they wait, without saying anything, Ikoma will go pick her up</font>

330
00:18:59,520 --> 00:18:59,960
<font face="Segoe UI Semibold" size="46">Just finished taking a bath</font>

331
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:00,880
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">What?</font>

332
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:04,340
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Okay, Nishino-san...</font>

333
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:06,340
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">We ran into each other in the hallway</font>

334
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:11,320
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Nishino-san, if you don't want to show your face, this is a no make-up guard</font>

335
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:16,120
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Everyone is here</font>

336
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:18,260
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Nishino-san... you're last</font>

337
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:20,440
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Nishino-san, you're the very last</font>

338
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:24,740
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Wrapping up, that was the true nature check. In last position is Nishino</font>

339
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:27,380
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">She's 30 minutes late</font>

340
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:30,940
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Suddenly I started to think there was a ghost</font>

341
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:32,740
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Because you heard the phone ringing?</font>

342
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:34,960
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">I thought it was the receptionist</font>

343
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,960
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Because it was so persistent</font>

344
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,320
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">I became afraid</font>

345
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,340
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">It's scary~</font>

346
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:40,800
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">You hate it</font>

347
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,800
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Somehow I hate it, scary~</font>

348
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,260
<font face="Segoe UI Semibold" size="46">Inagawa Junji impersonation</font>

349
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:48,100
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Why are you impersonating Inagawa</font>

350
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:51,600
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Doing an impersonation of Inagawa-san, +1 Macau</font>

351
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,400
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">You got one point</font>

352
00:19:55,770 --> 00:20:00,010
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Now Shitara has a proposal about their points</font>

353
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:02,780
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Having these two arrive very quickly after all</font>

354
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,590
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Start from the third position...</font>

355
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:10,520
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Their points will be deducted by how many minutes you were late</font>

356
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,120
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">What does that mean? 
- Wait a minute!</font>

357
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:18,630
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Therefore, third position and below get minus points according by how minutes they came late</font>

358
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:22,630
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Here is the ranking of their points</font>

359
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:24,800
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Are you scared, Nishino?</font>

360
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,910
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">You were like, it's scary~</font>

361
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:31,580
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Right, after I got out of bathroom, I heard sounds</font>

362
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:32,980
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">It's scary~</font>

363
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:35,980
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">You hate it</font>

364
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:37,620
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">I hate it~</font>

365
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:42,590
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">You get 1 Macau</font>

366
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:46,320
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Doing Inagawa's impersonation just gave you one point</font>

367
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:50,230
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">After this, they finally arrive at Macau Tower!</font>

368
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:56,440
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Everyone, please look at this!</font>

369
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:02,010
<font face="Segoe UI Semibold" size="46"></font>

370
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:04,480
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">This is Macau Tower</font>

371
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:07,550
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Looking at it from here...</font>

372
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:08,980
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Everyone is prepared, right?</font>

373
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:10,980
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">You're ready</font>

374
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,620
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">No? Takayama</font>

375
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,460
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">-10 Macau</font>

376
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:19,460
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">No, no, no</font>

377
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:21,320
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">If you get too many minus points here, it'll be the end of you</font>

378
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:23,820
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Nishino is not talking at all, -10 Macau</font>

379
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:26,820
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Last night you were last</font>

380
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:28,620
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">I'm prepared</font>

381
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,620
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">I don't want to lose 10 Macau points</font>

382
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:32,800
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Questioning the points, you get -5 Macau</font>

383
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:36,780
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Your points are getting deducted quite often</font>

384
00:21:38,440 --> 00:23:41,560
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Here is the MV of the 8th single, Kidzuitara Kataomoi. Please watch it!</font>

385
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:45,240
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Finally, who will jump from the tower?</font>

386
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:49,710
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">We must get one of you to jump</font>

387
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:52,480
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">But on top of the tower we can walk around...</font>

388
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,080
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">I know it
- You know?</font>

389
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,750
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">It's called skywalk</font>

390
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:57,750
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">You said it first, -10 Macau</font>

391
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:58,450
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Why!?</font>

392
00:23:58,450 --> 00:24:00,450
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">This is not good, information thief</font>

393
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:03,390
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">We talked about it earlier, didn't we?</font>

394
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:12,830
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Skywalk is a popular extreme attraction where you can walk outside the tower</font>

395
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:15,030
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">The three people from the bungee senbatsu</font>

396
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:21,940
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">You didn't participate in the previous waterfall campaign, so you will do the Skywalk</font>

397
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:26,140
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Don't you think you should do something</font>

398
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:27,510
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">I thought so</font>

399
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:29,450
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Please let us do this</font>

400
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:33,190
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Therefore, Skywalk, Skywalk, Skywalk...</font>

401
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:36,190
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Skywalk
- Stupid!</font>

402
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:38,690
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">I saw that coming</font>

403
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:59,010
<font face="Segoe UI" size="50">Who will be the one to jump?</font>
