<font size="40">Tonight, the big announcement of senbatsu members for the 8th single!</font>

2
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:17,200
<font size="40">An announcement filled with tears and laughter, 
a new era for Nogizaka46 opens up!</font>

3
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:23,100
<font size="40">Nogizakatte, Doko?</font>

4
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:40,820
<font size="40">DON!</font>

5
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:44,220
<font size="40">Nogizakatte Doko has started, we're your hosts, 
Bananaman, yoroshiku onegaishimasu~</font>

6
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:47,390
<font size="40">and here's... Nogizaka-chan~</font>

7
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:49,060
<font size="40"><b>Full Force.</b></font>

8
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:50,090
<font size="40">There are a lot of them.</font>

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,700
<font size="40">There are a lot of them here today, we even have the 2nd gen.</font>

10
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,070
<font size="40">They are here today.</font>

11
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:57,130
<font size="40">By the way, it’s still not everyone.</font>

12
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:59,870
<font size="40">Ichiki is not here because of schoolwork,</font>

13
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:04,680
<font size="40">then Takayama is now headed here from another job.</font>

14
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:05,540
<font size="40">-I see.</font>

15
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:07,910
<font size="40">About what we’re going to do today, Himura-san,</font>

16
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:10,080
<font size="40">Please go ahead and announce it.</font>

17
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,080
<font size="40">Today…</font>

18
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:16,420
<font size="40">We’ll announce the senbatsu members for the 8th single!</font>

19
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:22,660
<font size="40">It has finally arrived.</font>

20
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:27,160
<font size="40">This time, the 8th single will be on sale on the 2nd of April. 
That has been decided already.</font>

21
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:29,470
<font size="40">I see, so we’ll determine the members for that.</font>

22
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:30,730
<font size="40">That’s right.</font>

23
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:36,040
<font size="40">Along with the release of the 8th single, 
tonight we’ll announce the senbatsu members.</font>

24
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:38,510
<font size="40">We’ll start from the formation.</font>

25
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:42,280
<font size="40">This is the formation for the 8th single.</font>

26
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:51,490
<font size="40">Both first and second row has five members.</font>

27
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:55,220
<font size="40">And in the third row, there are six members.</font>

28
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:58,690
<font size="40">Yes, that's it. 
-Oh, 5-5-6</font>

29
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:03,430
<font size="40">And then, the five people in the first row will be the 5-Fukujin.</font>

30
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:07,600
<font size="40">There has been another change. 
-5-Fukujin.</font>

31
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:11,140
<font size="40">The number of Fukujin is changing.</font>

32
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:13,170
<font size="40">This time we have 5-Fukujin.</font>

33
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,040
<font size="40">A new formation with 5-5-6 members,</font>

34
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:19,510
<font size="40">We’ll start the announcement of the senbatsu members from the second row.</font>

35
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,420
<font size="40">We'll start the announcement from the second row, numbers 6-10.</font>

36
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:29,020
<font size="40">With that, please go ahead.</font>

37
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:30,060
<font size="40">First up,</font>

38
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:31,430
<font size="40">2nd row,</font>

39
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:33,360
<font size="40">#10</font>

40
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:38,070
<font size="40">The first member who will enter the senbatsu is…</font>

41
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:40,800
<font size="40">Fukagawa Mai</font>

42
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:44,070
<font size="40">hai, omedetou~</font>

43
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:49,640
<font size="40">First is Fukagawa Mai,</font>

44
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,650
<font size="40">a row forward from her position last time.</font>

45
00:02:54,650 --> 00:03:00,050
<font size="40">Last time, I was in third row,</font>

46
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:02,020
<font size="40">this time, I’m in the second row,</font>

47
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,530
<font size="40">I would like to do my best without forgetting my original resolve from the start.</font>

48
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:06,860
<font size="40">Thank you very much.</font>

49
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:08,360
<font size="40">omedetou gozaimasu~</font>

50
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:10,630
<font size="40">#10</font>

51
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:15,300
<font size="40">She's the first one who made it in the 8th single senbatsu.</font>

52
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,470
<font size="40">Let's move on.</font>

53
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:17,740
<font size="40">2nd row,</font>

54
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:19,040
<font size="40">#9</font>

55
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:23,040
<font size="40">The next member who will be called is...</font>

56
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:26,850
<font size="40">Matsumura Sayuri</font>

57
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:36,520
<font size="40">Matsumura was always a front member until now, 
this time she’s in the second row.</font>

58
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:42,430
<font size="40">From the start, I’ve always been… 
-You were always a Fukujin.</font>

59
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,930
<font size="40">7-Fukujin and 8-Fukujin, right? 
-Yes!</font>

60
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:48,430
<font size="40">It may be a different way of saying that I fell but,</font>

61
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,640
<font size="40">since I was not chosen to be in the 5-Fukujin,</font>

62
00:03:52,870 --> 00:04:00,710
<font size="40">I’m wondering if I was depending too much on that position.</font>

63
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:06,080
<font size="40">So that I would not depend on the position,</font>

64
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:10,590
<font size="40">and to keep that whatever position I end up with,</font>

65
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,430
<font size="40">I thought I have to work hard.</font>

66
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:15,090
<font size="40">That's right.</font>

67
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:16,090
<font size="40">I'll do my best.</font>

68
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:19,030
<font size="40">hai, omedetou gozaimasu~</font>

69
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:22,000
<font size="40">#9, huh?</font>

70
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,770
<font size="40">Very well, I'll continue with the announcement.</font>

71
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:27,540
<font size="40">2nd row,</font>

72
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:28,810
<font size="40">#8</font>

73
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:31,940
<font size="40">There are 14 remaining spots for the senbatsu,</font>

74
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:33,880
<font size="40">The next member is...</font>

75
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,580
<font size="40">Ikuta Erika</font>

76
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,520
<font size="40">Ikuta, hai, omedetou~</font>

77
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:44,620
<font size="40">She is out from being a Fukujin member,</font>

78
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:47,760
<font size="40">Ikuta, entered the senbatsu for 8 consecutive times.</font>

79
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:52,560
<font size="40">Even though I dropped from being a Fukujin,</font>

80
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:56,100
<font size="40">I am in the middle of the second row.</font>

81
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:59,240
<font size="40">Since this is the first time I’m assigned in this position…</font>

82
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:02,810
<font size="40">once again, I want to give it my all and work hard.</font>

83
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,540
<font size="40">Thank you very much. 
-hai, omedetou~</font>

84
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:10,350
<font size="40">I'll continue with the announcement.</font>

85
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,080
<font size="40">2nd row,</font>

86
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:13,580
<font size="40">#7</font>

87
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:16,150
<font size="40">There are two remaining spots in the second row,</font>

88
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,250
<font size="40">the next senbatsu member is...</font>

89
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:21,520
<font size="40">Wakatsuki Yumi</font>

90
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:31,470
<font size="40">For Wakatsuki as well, she is out of the Fukujin, 
she is in the second row just like the last time.</font>

91
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:37,770
<font size="40">I’ve always been in the third row, then last time, from the 3rd row,</font>

92
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:40,980
<font size="40">I’ve got a chance to be in the 2nd row and be a 8-Fukujin,</font>

93
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:43,680
<font size="40">This time, I’m in the second row again,</font>

94
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:50,050
<font size="40">Being in the 8-Fukujin last time, 
I was able to do various challenges for myself,</font>

95
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:52,690
<font size="40">I’m thinking there’s still a long way to go.</font>

96
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:58,660
<font size="40">I’m really grateful for being here in 2nd row, 
this is something I won’t forget.</font>

97
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:00,090
<font size="40"></font>

98
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:01,430
<font size="40">hai, omedetou~</font>

99
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,430
<font size="40">yoroshiku onegaishimasu</font>

100
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:07,900
<font size="40">Now, four of them have been decided. 
-Yes.</font>

101
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:11,000
<font size="40">All that's left in the second row is just one spot. 
-Yes.</font>

102
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:15,510
<font size="40">The last member selected for the second row is...</font>

103
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:19,110
<font size="40">Sakurai Reika</font>

104
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:21,380
<font size="40">Okay, it's Sakurai. Omedetou~</font>

105
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:29,590
<font size="40">Captain Sakurai, entered in the same position as the last single.</font>

106
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:38,560
<font size="40">I really appreciate being in the 2nd row this time as well,</font>

107
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:43,170
<font size="40">then there’s that feeling of wanting to try harder.</font>

108
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:52,640
<font size="40">My position never changes, it has always been the farthest on the right.</font>

109
00:06:53,150 --> 00:07:00,720
<font size="40">I’m happy… But won’t I be able to grow?</font>

110
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,720
<font size="40">I don’t think that’s true.</font>

111
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:05,490
<font size="40">It's like, because I'm the captain...</font>

112
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:13,900
<font size="40">I’m told that I’ll always be in the Fukujin.</font>

113
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,610
<font size="40">I'd like to do my best.</font>

114
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:23,670
<font size="40">Because it seems things are all set for you.</font>

115
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:26,210
<font size="40">It is annoying, when it is put that way.</font>

116
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:30,050
<font size="40">Please do your best in this position and shine brightly.</font>

117
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:30,350
<font size="40">Yes!</font>

118
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,820
<font size="40">An announcement filled with tears and laughter,</font>

119
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,890
<font size="40">the arrival of a new era!</font>

120
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:39,520
<font size="40">Where do we go from here? The third row?</font>

121
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:45,100
<font size="40">That’s right! Doing the front row first rather than the third…</font>

122
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:47,600
<font size="40">although I’m thinking we’ll start from the third row.</font>

123
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:51,700
<font size="40">Very well, from here, we’re going to announce the third row. 
-We’re going with the third row.</font>

124
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:54,140
<font size="40">First up in the 3rd row,</font>

125
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,310
<font size="40">#16</font>

126
00:07:56,270 --> 00:08:01,140
<font size="40">The first one to be called for the 3rd row is...</font>

127
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:02,680
<font size="40">Takayama Kazumi</font>

128
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:04,610
<font size="40">Oh? Takayama</font>

129
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:11,950
<font size="40">Moodmaker, Takayama, entered the senbatsu for 8 consecutive times.</font>

130
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:19,560
<font size="40">Since Takayama is currently traveling from a different job, 
she’ll be notified on the phone as soon as the call connects.</font>

131
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:25,470
<font size="40">There are only 10 members remaining!</font>

132
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:28,670
<font size="40">Among them, who are the 10 people that’ll make it?</font>

133
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:29,570
<font size="40">Let’s get going.</font>

134
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:32,270
<font size="40">Nerve-wracking senbatsu announcement,</font>

135
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,210
<font size="40">The next member is...</font>

136
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:36,610
<font size="40">Wada Maaya</font>

137
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:45,320
<font size="40">hai, omedetou~</font>

138
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:53,330
<font size="40">She has yet to enter the senbatsu until now, Wada Maaya,</font>

139
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:56,030
<font size="40">finally made it in the 8th single!</font>

140
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:59,230
<font size="40">This is your first senbatsu selection.</font>

141
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,500
<font size="40">Yes.</font>

142
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:04,840
<font size="40">Ever since I joined the group, I’ve always been an Under member,</font>

143
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:08,480
<font size="40">so I’m surprised,</font>

144
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,380
<font size="40">This is the first time I was chosen as a senbatsu member.</font>

145
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,420
<font size="40">It’s okay, don’t rush.</font>

146
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:24,760
<font size="40">So that I can show what I’ve done in under now that I’m in the senbatsu,</font>

147
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:29,230
<font size="40">so that I won’t hold everyone back, I want to do my best.</font>

148
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:31,370
<font size="40">That's great.</font>

149
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:33,500
<font size="40">#15 right?</font>

150
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:39,510
<font size="40">The other members are also happy for her.</font>

151
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:42,240
<font size="40">It became their joy as well.</font>

152
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:45,080
<font size="40">Now, Wada has been decided,</font>

153
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,710
<font size="40">Do we have Takayama on the line now?</font>

154
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:49,350
<font size="40">Takayama?</font>

155
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:50,680
<font size="40">Yes?</font>

156
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,820
<font size="40">Eh? Takayama, you sound like an old man right now.</font>

157
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:54,150
<font size="40"><b>Impersonation?</b></font>

158
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:56,560
<font size="40">Takayama?</font>

159
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,190
<font size="40">Takayama, are you on your way here?</font>

160
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:01,460
<font size="40">Yes, that’s right. What happened?</font>

161
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:05,460
<font size="40">Takayama, right now, we're doing the senbatsu announcement.</font>

162
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:08,100
<font size="40">Eh?! Right now?</font>

163
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:08,670
<font size="40">-Right now.</font>

164
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:13,740
<font size="40">Are you under water right now?</font>

165
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:15,610
<font size="40">While diving?</font>

166
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:17,840
<font size="40">You’re talking like you’re under water.</font>

167
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,340
<font size="40">I'm not under water.</font>

168
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:20,980
<font size="40">Takayama? 
-Yes?</font>

169
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:23,750
<font size="40">We’re here to tell you…</font>

170
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:25,120
<font size="40">Eh? Right now?</font>

171
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,820
<font size="40">We’ll tell you.</font>

172
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:32,560
<font size="40">Takayama-san, you’ve made it in the 8th single senbatsu.</font>

173
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:33,730
<font size="40">Thank you very much!</font>

174
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:35,060
<font size="40">hai, omedetou~</font>

175
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:42,830
<font size="40">This time, the formation from the front is 5-5-6.</font>

00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:43,630
<font size="40">buhi~</font>

00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,170
<font size="40">Buhi~</font>

00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:51,310
<font size="40">In the third row, on the...</font>

180
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:53,310
<font size="40">The farthest one on the right!</font>

181
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:54,610
<font size="40">Ah, how did you know?</font>

182
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:56,510
<font size="40"><b>Seer?</b></font>

183
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:58,450
<font size="40">How did you know? 
-That's right, you got that right!</font>

184
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:01,850
<font size="40">I just thought there’s where I’d be.</font>

185
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:06,160
<font size="40">Please tell us how you feel right now.</font>

186
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:09,690
<font size="40">Sorry I didn’t make it in time.</font>

187
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:12,130
<font size="40">I really don't know what mood the studio has right now...</font>

188
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:15,170
<font size="40">The mood is completely different!</font>

189
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:17,070
<font size="40"><b>Endless difference.</b></font>

190
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:19,340
<font size="40">That’s what I’m concerned about right now.</font>

191
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:21,270
<font size="40">I’m sorry about that. 
-See you later.</font>

192
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:28,110
<font size="40">Until now, there has not been a senbatsu announcement with this kind of mood.</font>

193
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:29,750
<font size="40">As expected from Takayama.</font>

194
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:36,050
<font size="40">Takayama got in the #16 spot, then, right now, Wada got in the #15 spot.</font>

195
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:40,220
<font size="40">There are 9 remaining. Let's move along.</font>

196
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:44,630
<font size="40">Next, #14, the member who will be called is...</font>

197
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:47,660
<font size="40">Akimoto Manatsu</font>

198
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,630
<font size="40">Akimoto, omedetou~</font>

199
00:11:55,170 --> 00:12:00,480
<font size="40">Akimoto who started in the 4th single, 
entered the senbatsu for 5 consecutive times.</font>

200
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,710
<font size="40">First of all, thank you for choosing me for the senbatsu.</font>

201
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:08,580
<font size="40">I'm really happy for being in the senbatsu this time as well,</font>

202
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:14,190
<font size="40">but the place I was aiming for is a little higher than this.</font>

203
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:17,690
<font size="40">It seems that I can’t reach it yet with the abilities I have right now.</font>

204
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:20,300
<font size="40">I’m putting a lot of effort,</font>

205
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:27,240
<font size="40">Even in this 14th spot, I’ll have my own way in order to shine.</font>

206
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,970
<font size="40">I want to find that,</font>

207
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:33,810
<font size="40">and I want to be an idol who will make everyone smile.</font>

208
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:34,680
<font size="40">I'll do my best.</font>

209
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:37,080
<font size="40">Please proceed to the #14 spot. 
-omedetou gozaimasu~</font>

00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:44,450
<font size="40">Half of the spots for senbatsu are already occupied, 
the next one who’ll be called is…</font>

00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,050
<font size="40">Higuchi Hina</font>

212
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:50,720

00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,270
<font size="40">Higuchi Hina kept waiting for her chance,</font>

215
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:02,440
<font size="40">she finally entered the senbatsu in the 8th single.</font>

216
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:04,240
<font size="40">Your first selection? 
-Yes.</font>

217
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,810
<font size="40">So this is your first? 
-Yes.</font>

218
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:09,110
<font size="40">Her first senbatsu selection.</font>

219
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,150
<font size="40">I've always been an Under member,</font>

220

<font size="40">Huh?</font>

223
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:25,420
<font size="40">Why did you touch me?</font>

224
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:26,430
<font size="40"><b>Suspicious behavior.</b></font>

225
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:28,860
<font size="40">Those were your fans, right? What family was it?</font>

226
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:30,800
<font size="40">Hinachima Family. 
-Hinachima?</font>

227
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:33,470
<font size="40">Everyone in Hinachima Family will be glad about this.</font>

237
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:03,560
<font size="40">Come here.</font>

238
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:09,800
<font size="40">Kitano Hinako, following Hori from the last single,</font>

239
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:12,400
<font size="40">she is the second from the 2nd gen who made it in the senbatsu.</font>

00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:19,280
<font size="40">All of my efforts were not enough,</font>

242
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,380
<font size="40">It’s like…</font>

243
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:24,750
<font size="40">I can’t meet the expectations of those around me,</font>

244
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:26,780
<font size="40">I’m always frustrated by that.</font>

245
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,390
<font size="40">I’m bad at dancing,</font>

246
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:32,720
<font size="40">then, I really think that I don’t have any good points.</font>

247
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:37,790
<font size="40">From now on, so that I could meet the expectations of other people,</font>

248
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:42,600
<font size="40">I would work hard every day. I hope that I’d be able to shine.</font>

<font size="40">the fans are always comforting me.</font>

265
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:55,940
<font size="40">I was thinking that I want to repay them as soon as possible.</font>

266
00:15:58,070 --> 00:16:00,410
<font size="40">You were finally able to repay them.</font>

267
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:03,210
<font size="40">Since I am chosen for the 8th single,</font>

268
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,110
<font size="40">I'll do it with all I got.</font>

269
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:08,120
<font size="40">Do your best, okay? Please proceed to your spot.</font>

00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:17,120
<font size="40">All that's left is the 1st row,</font>

271

-Yes!</font>

285
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:03,600
<font size="40">About the row... it’s been a while since I got in the 1st row,</font>

287
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:07,670
<font size="40">Oh, I see, so that’s how it goes.</font>

288

<font size="40">Recently, in various variety shows or even live shows,</font>

289
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:22,950
<font size="40">What I’m thinking of the most is the benefit for Nogizaka46, more than for myself.</font>

290
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:33,000
<font size="40">But I’m also wondering if I’m getting noticed by other people.</font>

291
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:39,400
<font size="40">But this time, I was given a spot where I could easily be seen.</font>

292
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:42,840
<font size="40">I won’t waste this chance,</font>

293
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:46,380
<font size="40">so that I can be noticed by other people as well,</font>

294
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,980
<font size="40">I want to give it all I’ve got.</font>

295
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:54,320
<font size="40">”For myself, for the group,” I think it’s good to have those kinds of worries.</font>

296
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:58,790
<font size="40">I mean, this is not a group that has been around for a decade,</font>

297
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,430
<font size="40">Aren’t those various activities you do each day what makes you grow?</font>

298
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:04,660
<font size="40">I’ll do my best. 
-Please do your best.</font>

299
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:06,300
<font size="40">Please proceed to the #5 spot.</font>

300
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,540
<font size="40">Then right here, Takayama arrived late because of another job.</font>

301
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:17,870
<font size="40">What do you think about this?</font>

302
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:19,240
<font size="40">Uhmm, eh?</font>

303
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:21,640
<font size="40">I'm surprised with this formation.</font>

304
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,680
<font size="40">Kitano, a 2nd gen, also made it in.</font>

305
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,410
<font size="40">Ahh,</font>

306
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:26,120
<font size="40">Hhmm,</font>

307
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:28,050
<font size="40">Higuchi made it in.</font>

308
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:30,220
<font size="40">That’s great. I’m happy for her.</font>

309
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:32,150
<font size="40">Kawamura as well.</font>

310
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:33,960
<font size="40">So there’s where Ikoma-chan is.</font>

311
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,090
<font size="40">Ah~ I see.</font>

312
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:35,990
<font size="40">What is your impression about this?</font>

313
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:37,960
<font size="40">Wait a sec, you’re not an old woman so you don’t have to talk like that.</font>

314
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:38,790
<font size="40">Gossip?</font>

315
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:40,730
<font size="40">”Ah, so, there’s where she is.”</font>

316
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:43,330
<font size="40">Well, it’s about the mood right? The atmosphere in this studio…</font>

317
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:44,730
<font size="40">-I don’t have an idea about it.</font>

318
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:48,170
<font size="40">I’m really happy I got in,</font>

319
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:53,170
<font size="40">For the next single, moving a step closer…</font>

320
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:55,610
<font size="40">Ah! So there’s where Maimai is.</font>

321
00:18:55,610 --> 00:18:57,950
<font size="40"><b>New discovery after another!</b></font>

322
00:18:57,950 --> 00:18:58,910
<font size="40">What are you doing?</font>

323
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:01,250
<font size="40">Just go to your spot.</font>

324
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:02,220
<font size="40">Do your best, okay?</font>

325
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:09,790
<font size="40">Certainly, coming in a senbatsu announcement with this kind of timing, you can’t really grasp what the atmosphere is.</font>

326
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:16,060
<font size="40">It’s like, she’s surprised with the position the members have.</font>

327
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:18,070
<font size="40">What are you discussing about over there?!</font>

328
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:20,230
<font size="40"><b>Murmuring is prohibited!</b></font>

329
00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:21,900
<font size="40">Very well, I'll continue with the announcement.</font>

330
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,770
<font size="40">1st row,</font>

331
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:25,140
<font size="40">#1</font>

332
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:29,140
<font size="40">The next front member who will be selected is...</font>

333
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:32,780
<font size="40">Hori Miona</font>

334
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:40,520
<font size="40">In the last single, Hori is selected as the center.</font>

335
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,460
<font size="40">For the 8th single, she is a front member.</font>

336
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:51,030
<font size="40">I was first selected as a senbatsu member in the 7th single,</font>

337
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:55,070
<font size="40">then I was the center.</font>

338
00:19:57,170 --> 00:20:02,440
<font size="40">At first, I was very anxious.</font>

339
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,940
<font size="40">I was wondering if that was okay,</font>

340
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:11,920
<font size="40">I was really scared, and then I had all sorts of thoughts,</font>

341
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:18,620
<font size="40">but the surrounding senpais also supported me a lot.</font>

342
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:24,060
<font size="40">It was a personality that I had never seen before.</font>

343
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:26,770
<font size="40">It's like...</font>

344
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:31,370
<font size="40">I was thinking that I wanted to do more things myself.</font>

345
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:38,310
<font size="40">This time, I want to work hard in this position my own way.</font>

346
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:40,580
<font size="40">Please proceed to the #1 spot. 
-Thank you very much.</font>

347
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:43,550
<font size="40">Now then, Himura-san. 
-Yes?</font>

348
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:46,180
<font size="40">The last center, Hori, is called in this spot.</font>

349
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:50,450
<font size="40">It’s great, Hori even made it in the 5-Fukujin.</font>

350
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:53,660
<font size="40">There are three spots remaining,</font>

351
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:56,590
<font size="40">who will be called for the #4 spot?</font>

352
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:00,160
<font size="40">Hashimoto Nanami</font>

353
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:02,070
<font size="40">omedetou~~~~</font>

354
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:10,540
<font size="40">A Fukujin member in all of the previous singles, Hashimoto, 
she is in the front row this time as well.</font>

355
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:16,280
<font size="40">Since I’ll be at the same position as before,</font>

356
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:22,190
<font size="40">I guess for those people who will come to see me in live shows, they will be able to see me easily.</font>

357
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:24,920
<font size="40">Beyond that,</font>

358
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:32,060
<font size="40">I will do my best in order to become a person who will be noticed regardless of my position.</font>

359
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:34,430
<font size="40">Although there are those who are familiar with you already.</font>

360
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:38,200
<font size="40">But aim for the top. Do your best.</font>

361
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,240
<font size="40">Thank you very much.</font>

362
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:41,770
<font size="40">#4 spot right? omedetou gozaimasu~</font>

363
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:43,010
<font size="40">hai, omedetou~</font>

364
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:51,210
<font size="40">After this, with the announcement of the center comes a new era!</font>

365
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:54,050
<font size="40">Very well, I'll continue with the announcement.</font>

366
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:56,120
<font size="40">1st row,</font>

367
00:21:57,050 --> 00:21:57,920
<font size="40">#2</font>

368
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:01,020
<font size="40">Next, 1st row, #2,</font>

369
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:03,290
<font size="40">Whose name will be called?</font>

370
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:06,490
<font size="40">Shiraishi Mai</font>

371
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:08,760
<font size="40">hai, omedetou~</font>

372
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:14,740
<font size="40">Shiraishi who served as the center for the 6th single,</font>

373
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:17,140
<font size="40">following the last single, she made it in as a front member.</font>

374
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:21,410
<font size="40">I’ve been chosen as a senbatsu from the beginning,</font>

375
00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:28,320
<font size="40">For every single, I have seen a lot of issues about myself that I have to address from within,</font>

376
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:34,690
<font size="40">I find myself growing up little by little because of it.</font>

377
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:38,060
<font size="40">I can see the members around me working hard,</font>

378
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:44,060
<font size="40">I think that’s why Nogizaka was able to grow immensely to this point,</font>

379
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:53,010
<font size="40">For the 8th single, I’m assigned at the same position as the last single,</font>

380
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:55,480
<font size="40">So that I can support the members around me properly,</font>

381
00:22:55,480 --> 00:23:00,710
<font size="40">and so that I can bring my own color out, I’d like to keep working hard.</font>

382
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:06,050
<font size="40">Please work hard in the 8th single, do it as Nogizaka’s face. 
-I’ll do my best.</font>

383
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:07,990
<font size="40">Please do your best. 
-Thank you very much.</font>

384
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:15,860
<font size="40">This is the birth to a new center no matter who gets chosen,</font>

385
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,560
<font size="40">Whose hands will it be handed to?</font>

386
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,300
<font size="40">Nishino Nanase</font>

387
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:31,610
<font size="40">Nishino who entered the front row last time,</font>

388
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:35,210
<font size="40">is appointed as Nogizaka46’s 4th center.</font>

389
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:38,680
<font size="40">It’s like…</font>

390
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:46,460
<font size="40">Even back then, because I was never a person who would be at a situation similar to being a center...</font>

391
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:49,530
<font size="40">I do not feel anything right now.</font>

392
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:55,500
<font size="40">I‘ve heard that the person who would become a center</font>

393
00:23:56,030 --> 00:24:05,280
<font size="40">is someone who can bring out the strengths of the surrounding members.</font>

394
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:12,980
<font size="40">So that I could bring out the strengths of the surrounding members…</font>

395
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:16,990
<font size="40">I’d like to learn a lot from this opportunity.</font>

396
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:20,390
<font size="40">Please shine. Please proceed to the center spot.</font>

397
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:26,360
<font size="40">It’s a really interesting one this time.</font>

398
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,500
<font size="40">With the new center Nishino in the middle,</font>

399
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:34,040
<font size="40">The new look of Nogizaka46 starts at the 8th single!</font>

400
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:36,040
<font size="40"></font>
