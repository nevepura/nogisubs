45
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,600

46
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:44,540
<font size="38">The one-pieces dress fit very well with her cute aura.</font>

47
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:47,160
<font size="38">I think this is really good,</font>

48
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:51,380
<font size="38">and the stocks are lovely.</font>

49
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:55,180
<font size="38">But the heels shoes is in red color.</font>

50
00:02:55,180 --> 00:03:02,160
<font size="38">If she matched them with a simpler color like brown or black color,</font>

51
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:08,420
<font size="38">the overall feeling could've been more outstanding.</font>

52
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:12,480
<font size="38">What score should I give? Let me think.</font>

53
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,660
<font size="38">65 points.</font>

54
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,860
<font size="38">Next up, its Miyazawa Seira's with the cool and sexy style clothes combination.</font>

55
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:23,500
<font size="38">-So Miyazawa like this style huh? -Not bad, Miyazawa.</font>

56
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,360
<font size="38">-Where's Miyazawa? -Over there.</font>

57
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:32,300
<font size="38">She wore a very conspicuous stripe,</font>

58
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:36,920
<font size="38">it really fit well with her mature aura.</font>

59
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:40,020
<font size="38">I'll give 90 points.</font>

60
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:44,820
<font size="38">-Fukagawa. -Fukagawawa~~~</font>

61
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:51,480
<font size="38">My main fashion focus for today is about this small jacket that I don't usually wear.</font>

62
00:03:51,700 --> 00:04:01,000
<font size="38">So to not make it look too tight, I wore a loose T-shirt inside to balance them.</font>

63
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,500
<font size="38">And actually, I sewed this small jacket all by myself.</font>

64
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,540
<font size="38">That jacket? Really?</font>

65
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,560
<font size="38">The lower part is a little bit off.</font>

66
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:20,060
<font size="38">But the jacket's really hard to make, its hard to believe someone actually made that alone.</font>

67
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:23,820
<font size="38">The skirt fit really good, like a balance between them.</font>

68
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:28,120
<font size="38">The only problem is that why did she picked that shoes.</font>

69
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,040
<font size="38">That is the only problem.</font>

70
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:41,640
<font size="38">If she had a grey or monotone outfit, it would be better if the shoes were black.</font>

71
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,580
<font size="38">75 points for her.</font>

72
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:49,820
<font size="38">Next up is Sakurai Reika, who wore a simple one-piece dress.</font>

74
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:02,520
<font size="38">What will the main editor comment on this dress?</font>

75
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:09,120
<font size="38">The dress is very modern and simple, really good fashionable.</font>

76
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,980
<font size="38">But why did I get an old women aura from her?</font>

77
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:16,140
<font face="Times New Roman" size="32">{\an8}<s><i>You just got burned, girl. </i></s></font>

78
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:22,340
<font size="38">For advice, if the overall color is simple like only black and white color,</font>

79
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:28,220
<font size="38">to avoid that it looks like a dress you would've wear when you're going to a funeral,</font>

80
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:33,700
<font size="38">she can wear a long stockings, or add clothes with a little bit of colors on it.</font>

81
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,160
<font size="38">It will become better, please try it next time.</font>

82
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,400

87
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:02,140
<font size="38">The main point will be the colorful shawl.</font>

88
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:05,360
<font size="38">Oh... Very nice!</font>

89
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:15,460
<font size="38">The shawl looks very nice, and she's really suitable for a short hairstyle.</font>

90
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:19,020

94
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:38,440
<font size="38">-very fashionable. -This is Nakada?</font>

95
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:43,760

99
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:03,360
<font size="38">but it kinda felt weird when she wore them all together.</font>

100
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:09,000
<font size="38">First of all, the length of the coat and the dress did not match well together.</font>

101
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,480
<font size="38">I don't understand them.</font>

102
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:15,720
<font size="38">For the legs part, its bad too.</font>

103
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:19,600
<font size="38">Maybe it will become better if she wore a black shoes.</font>

104

115
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,120
<font size="38">I'm so happy.</font>

116
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:19,340
<font size="38">But Miyazawa doesn't look very good over here.</font>

117
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:23,360
<font size="38">What do you mean?</font>

118
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:27,720
<font size="38">-But...but when I saw her personal clothes. -That kind of feeling...</font>

124
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:57,720

131
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:42,300

<font size="38">-What about her legs? -The overall was very fashionable.</font>

133

<font size="38">and inside that is a dress.</font>

145
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:46,640
<font size="38">A dress inside a white knitwear, that kind of fashion style.</font>

146
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:53,100
<font size="38">Wearing grey stockings, and a spectacle in front of her knitwear.</font>

147
00:10:53,100 --> 00:11:03,920
<font size="38">-Not bad. -Yes, I agree.</font>

148
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,300
<font size="38">She did not pick a black stocking but one with the grey color.</font>

149
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:11,420
<font size="38">That makes her look more fashionable.</font>

150
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:14,120
<font size="38">80 points.</font>

151
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:21,880
<font size="38">Next up, Ito Marika. Combining a boot with leopard stripes, the rocker style.</font>

152
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:26,600
<font size="38">And the use of hoodie and a pleated skirt works as they bring out the contrast between two styles.</font>

153
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,280
<font size="38">The scary part is that she's only 15 years old.</font>

154
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:40,580
<font size="38">The boot fits well with the purple stocking and the leopard stripes.</font>

155
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,460
<font size="38">75 points.</font>

156
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:45,660
<font size="38">Nishino.</font>

157
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:49,580
<font size="38">Nishino's 95 points are the highest points so far.</font>

158
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,720
<font size="38">Nishino is not here with us today.</font>

159
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,000
<font size="38">-Is she not present? -Too bad.</font>

160
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,440
<font size="38">-Is she here? Oh, Nishino is here.</font>

161
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,000
<font size="38">Come over here Nishino.</font>

162
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,580
<font size="38">-Did you wear your personal clothes on today too? -Yes.</font>

163
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:03,280
<font size="38">-Kawai.</font>

164
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:06,240
<font size="38">This style is totally different than the one shown in the video.</font>

165
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,320
<font size="38">Little girl, open up your button, let me be happy. -No no no, no way.</font>

166
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,780
<font size="38">If someone in the group does not have any fashion sense, you'll teach them, right?</font>

167
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:16,200
<font size="38">Since you're a fashion leader.</font>

168
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,180
<font size="38">Himura-san who do you think looks good?</font>

169
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:20,300
<font size="38">Takayama, not bad.</font>

170
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,740
<font size="38">-Kawaii. -Thank you very much.</font>

171
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,920
<font size="38">90 points.</font>

172
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,980
<font size="38">And you have a good figure too.</font>

173
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:29,280
<font size="38">-Did you wear a dark green stocking? -Yes, that's it.</font>

174
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,400
<font size="38">-You got a good rating. -I'm honored.</font>

175
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:37,780
<font size="38">I'm actually very cautious when it comes to money, and I usually buy according to their price, not their appearance.</font>

176
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:40,200
<font size="38">-You know how to pick your stuff. -Thank you.</font>

177
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:43,860
<font size="38">That's fashion. Even if you did not have much you can still look fashionable.</font>

178
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:45,860
<font size="38">Right... Ogi-san you and your partner were really fashionable right?</font>

179
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:48,360
<font size="38">Yes...What do you mean yes!?</font>

180
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:51,340
<font size="38">Shitara-san, you're the real fashionable person.</font>

181
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,360
<font size="38">Yes...What do you mean yes!?</font>

182
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,380
<font size="38">Himura-san, were you always this rustic?</font>

183
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,100
<font size="38">WHAT ARE U TALKIN ABOUT!?</font>

184
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:01,400
<font size="38">It felt like we're on an American comedy show.</font>

185
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:06,280
<font size="38">Ogi-san, actually there's one more plan for today.</font>

186
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:11,320
<font size="38">Ummm, who should read the title out this time?</font>

187
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:15,000
<font size="38">Please use a funny way to read the title out ok?</font>

188
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,780
<font size="38">Ogi-san!!!</font>

189
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,160
<font size="38">What should I say?</font>

190
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:24,060
<font size="38">The title of the next plan. Please make it funny. -What do you mean funny!?</font>

191
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:33,240
<font size="38">Who's the best dancer in Nogizaka46!? Nogizaka Dance Skill Check!!</font>

192
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:42,360
<font size="38">Nogizaka46 Dance Skill Check.</font>

193
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:46,860
<font size="38">The verification dance class started 3 months ago.</font>

194
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:52,480
<font size="38">Only seven best dancers among them can show their dance skill in the studio.</font>

195
00:13:52,480 --> 00:14:01,320
<font size="38">The seven-person who can present their dance beautifully will be able to perform in the studio.</font>

196
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,380
<font size="38">They had to use one hour to memorize a 30 seconds dance move.</font>

197
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:13,080
<font size="38">Everyone began at the same point. They'll have to learn from their teacher and adept the dance moves.</font>

198
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,120
<font size="38">Everyone's hardworking.</font>

199
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:19,160
<font size="38">Hand... leg... one...</font>

200
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:22,320
<font size="38">Although its only a 30 seconds move, the moves are not easy to learn.</font>

201
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,140
<font size="38">They'll need to mashup every moves to form a complete dance.</font>

202
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:31,100
<font size="38">It will be hard for them since they only started their lessons 3 months ago.</font>

203
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:35,520
<font size="38">One hour has passed.</font>

204
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:40,120
<font size="38">They managed to learn all of the dance moves and were currently doing last rehearsal.</font>

205
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,740
<font size="38">Although they only had limited time,</font>

206
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:47,140
<font size="38">the members managed to digest everything their teacher had taught them.</font>

207
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:51,880
<font size="38">Right before the filming start...</font>

208
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:56,700
<font size="38">Ah, that's how they were during their classes.</font>

209
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,700
<font size="38">Rekai is in the shot.</font>

210
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:02,560
<font size="38">I'm excited so I decided to wear this.</font>

211
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,740
<font size="38">-Michael Jackson. -I get that a lot.</font>

212
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,800
<font size="38">Like you're actually performing...</font>

213
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,560
<font size="38">Just like Michel Jackson.</font>

214
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,300
<font size="38">Ahhh~~~~~~~♥</font>

215
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,200
<font size="38">The test will be divided into three groups.</font>

216
00:15:18,840 --> 00:16:06,780
<font size="38">Who will be the one to be crowned as the skilled dancer?</font>

217
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:09,440
<font size="38">Now for the second group.</font>

218
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,980
<font size="38">They all look nervous.</font>

219
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:37,320
<font size="38">-Those are some big dance moves. -Not bad.</font>

220
00:16:50,440 --> 00:17:06,620
<font size="38">And here's the last group.</font>

221
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:09,940
<font size="38">They all learned this at the same time.</font>

222
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:20,400
<font size="38">They were all smiling.</font>

223
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,920
<font size="38">Yeah, that's good.</font>

224
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:38,000
<font size="38">Finally, who will be the only seven members to perform in the studio?</font>

225
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:42,420
<font size="38">Firstly, Ikoma.</font>

226
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:48,200
<font size="38">Nakada.</font>

227
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,880
<font size="38">Ikuta.</font>

228
00:17:56,820 --> 00:18:00,620
<font size="38">Kawamura.</font>

229
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:02,360
<font size="38">Sakurai.</font>

230
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,540
<font size="38">Asuka.</font>

231
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:08,520
<font size="38">Inoue.</font>

232
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:14,860
<font size="38">Everyone, good luck!</font>

233
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:20,680
<font size="38">The seven members that were picked were moved to tears.</font>

234
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:24,100
<font size="38">They are going to perform in the studio shortly!</font>

235
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:32,860
<font size="38">Ikoma, that's right. You did well on dancing but you're kinda bad at sport?</font>

236
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:38,020
<font size="38">I do not have the ability to do sports at all.</font>

237
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:40,580
<font size="38">But I can dance very well.</font>

238
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:45,000
<font size="38">-Sakurai, you cried too right? -"Michael".</font>

239
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:49,180
<font size="38">-Yeah, I wore the jacket. -Not bad.</font>

240
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:56,120
<font size="38">I tried my best, and I think I did my best.</font>

241
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:03,840
<font size="38">But well, that didn't count as a failure as well.</font>

242
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:11,240
<font size="38">Even if you forgot your line during a live performance, it's ok.</font>

243
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:14,720
<font size="38">"The guy has a funny looking face," or maybe</font>

244
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,780
<font size="38">"I'd never seen such things before,"</font>

245
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,120
<font size="38">Nobody would ever say that.</font>

246
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:21,680
<font size="38">Yes, they're talking about you Himura-san.</font>

247
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:24,480
<font size="38">Yes, we're talking about you Himura-san.</font>

248
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:27,320
<font size="38">That's why the audience is hooked, because of your face.</font>

249
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,200
<font size="38">like "WHAT DA HELL IS THIS?"</font>

250
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:30,680
<font size="38">"What the hell is this!?"</font>

251
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,160
<font size="38">YOU SHUT UP!</font>

252
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,680
<font size="38">The next person is Inoue. -Are you surprised?(That she was selected.)</font>

253
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,840
<font size="38">I think so too myself.</font>

254
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:43,460
<font size="38">-Even you look capable? -Yeah, you look capable.</font>

255
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:47,540
<font size="38">Everyone thought I'm a capable person but actually, I'm very bad.</font>

256
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:49,540
<font size="38">-No no no.</font>

257
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:52,240
<font size="38">I didn't have dance lessons before this.</font>

258
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:56,580
<font size="38">During the first lesson, everyone danced so well</font>

259
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:59,080
<font size="38">and I thought the situation was bad for me.</font>

260
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:05,600
<font size="38">That's what all this about, three months ago all of you know nothing.</font>

261
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:11,620
<font size="38">But as the time progress with your continuous efforts, you grew up.</font>

262
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:17,420
<font size="38">So in other words, those who Inoue had overtaken have to be really careful in the future.</font>

263
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:19,040
<font size="38">If you do not start working hard...</font>

264
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:22,920
<font size="38">-You're really something else Ogi-san! -It's only your first meeting with them...</font>

265
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,920
<font size="38">-Who're you to judge them. -No no no.</font>

266
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:27,820
<font size="38">So do not be overtaken.</font>

267
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:32,180
<font size="38">You have to have the mentality of surpassing other people.</font>

268
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:36,300
<font size="38">It will be over for you if you gave up just because you did not get picked.</font>

269
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,460
<font size="60"><b>Got it!?</b></font>

270
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:42,780
<font size="60">You guys better keep up the good work.</font>

271
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:48,380
<font size="38">When we saw Kawamura, we were discussing her too.</font>

272
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:50,140
<font size="38">Your dance movements look good.</font>

273
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:53,380
<font size="38">Did anyone ever tell you that you are a very energetic person?</font>

274
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:54,060
<font size="60">What????</font>

275
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:59,180
<font size="38">Very energetic indeed.</font>

276
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:02,660
<font size="38">-Nobody told me that before. -Your movements are very big.</font>

277
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:05,620
<font size="38">Because I love to d-d-d-dance the most.</font>

278
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,380
<font size="38">So you like to d-d-d-dance.</font>

279
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:15,000
<font size="38">I learned how to dance before.</font>

280
00:21:16,200 --> 00:22:02,860
<font size="38">The seven dance sichifukujin will begin their performance after the commercial break.</font>

281
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:07,080
<font size="38">What? If there's a mistake its ok. Don't worry.</font>

282
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:10,540
<font size="38">-You guys did well -Very good.</font>

283
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:17,620
<font size="38">After this, who's the one that stole Ogi-san's heart?</font>

284
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:18,460
<font size="38">Ogi-san, from what you saw today, please pick your oshimen*.</font>

285
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:25,900
<font face="Times New Roman" size="32">{\an8}Oshimen ( 推しメン ) is a term used to describe a fan's #1 favorite member in a group.</font>

286
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:30,680
