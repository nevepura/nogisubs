00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:11,000
<font size="35">Just before the dreaded jump</font>

00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:15,000
<font size="35">Something unthinkable will happen to Captain Sakurai!</font>

4
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:23,500
<font size="35">Will the 6th single campaign really end in success?</font>

00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:52,750
<font size="35">Sorry about that. Nogizaka tte Doko's started, we're your hosts Bananaman, enjoy the show!</font>

00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
<font size="35">And heeere's Nogizaka-chan!</font>

10
00:00:59,750 --> 00:00:59,750
<font size="35">Here we go, look that way!</font>

<font size="35">Oh no, I lost</font>

13
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,000
<font size="35">I lost</font>

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
<font size="35">Today we're going to</font>

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,750
<font size="35">Well, last week was just the first installment</font>

16
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:18,250
<font size="35">We only discussed who was going to perform the bungee jump for the single campaign</font>

17
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:21,000
<font size="35">Now we're finally getting to the sequel</font>

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
<font size="35">We get to see who really did the bungee jump</font>

19
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,000
<font size="35">Who was it really?</font>

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
<font size="35">Not "Who was it?", we already decided on Sakurai</font>

21
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,750
<font size="35">OK, let's get on with it</font>

22
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:33,000
<font size="35">Sakurai, today you do the introduction</font>

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
<font size="35">-Yes!</font>

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,500
<font size="35">OK, video footage, go!</font>

25
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,000
<font size="35">What was that?</font>

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,250
<font size="35">The 6th single campaign was announced last week</font>

27
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:50,250
<font size="35">And the activity chosen was</font>

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,000
<font size="35">Promoting the single through a bungee jump!</font>

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:07,000
<font size="35">From among the front row members, one was chosen as a representative</font>

30
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,000
<font size="35">Isn't Kazumin trying to hide in the background too much?</font>

31
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,500
<font size="35">You need to jump and train your nerves!</font>

32
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:22,500
<font size="35">The members took place in a heated discussion</font>

33
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,500
<font size="35">And then all 16 senbatsu members voted for the representative</font>

34
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:33,000
<font size="35">And the one chosen for the famously horrific jump was</font>

35
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
<font size="35">Sakurai!!</font>

36
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:41,500
<font size="35">The one taking the challenge will be the captain, Sakurai</font>

37
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,300
<font size="35">And Takayama was chosen as her backup</font>

38
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:44,400
<font size="35">Tsubokura Yoshiyuki</font>

39
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,000
<font size="35">Watabe Jun</font>

40
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,000
<font size="35">And so, we're here at Minakami, Gunba prefecture!</font>

41
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
<font size="25">{\an8}[T/L: The guest hosts are from the comedy group Wagaya, they were guests on Nogizaka tte Doko early on]</font>

42
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
<font size="35">It's been a long time since we saw you</font>

43
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,500
<font size="35">It's been a long time</font>

44
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:57,000
<font size="35">You guys really seem like top idols these days</font>

45
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:01,000
<font size="35">You all seem completely different to when we first met</font>

46
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:03,750
<font size="35">One person here looks weirdly underdressed though</font>

47
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,000
<font size="35">-What's up with that?</font>

48
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,500
<font size="35">Why are you wearing that?</font>

49
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:11,000
<font size="35">There is a good reason, I have a nasty allergy to insect bites</font>

50
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,250
<font size="35">There you go; the drama emerged</font>

51
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:13,000
<font size="35">-She's a real diva actress!</font>

52
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,750
<font size="35">She's a real diva actress!</font>

53
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:14,500
<font size="35">-The special insect bite excuse</font>

54
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,000
<font size="35">The special insect bite excuse</font>

55
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
<font size="35">Out came the special treatment!</font>

56
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:22,000
<font size="35">And so this time we're going to be doing a bungee jump</font>

57
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,250
<font size="35">The height of the bungee jumping spot next to us is an eye-watering 42 metres!</font>

58
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,500
<font size="35">Shall we take a quick look?</font>

59
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,500
<font size="35">This would be scary if you looked down</font>

60
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
<font size="35">Looking down before you jump...</font>

61
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,500
<font size="35">I've done this before, if you looked down first it would be really hard</font>

62
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,250
<font size="35">This time the single campaign is a bungee jump from a bridge</font>

63
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:52,000
<font size="35">The height is the same as a 12 story building: 42 metres!</font>

64
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,000
<font size="35">If you compare it to the previous skydiving campaign</font>

65
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
<font size="35">It's scary because you need to jump yourself</font>

66
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,500
<font size="35">Now the single campaign will swing into motion!</font>

67
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,000
<font size="35">Nowaynowaynowaynowaynowaynowaynowaynoway this is impossible!</font>

68
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,500
<font size="35">-Captain!</font>

69
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,500
<font size="35">-What's wrong captain?</font>

70
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,000
<font size="35">-This place is scary</font>

71
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:16,500
<font size="35">What's wrong?</font>

72
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:20,500
<font size="35">Actually, if you want to have a hit, this is the place to come</font>

73
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:20,500
<font size="35">Famous people who jumped here include Ninety-Nine</font>

80
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,250
<font size="35">That's right</font>

<font size="25">{\an8}Sugiyama Hiroyuki</font>

84
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,500
<font size="35">By the way Sugiyama tried this and he retired</font>

85
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,750
<font size="35">"Retire"? He just wussed out</font>

86
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:51,000
<font size="35">But if you guys can perform a bungee jump here, your single will definitely become a big hit!</font>

87
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,000
<font size="35">Right?</font>

88
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,500
<font size="35">Isn't it good that you were chosen by everyone last time?</font>

89
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,500
<font size="35">How is your mental state right now?</font>

90
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
<font size="35">Well, because such harsh things were said about me</font>

91
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,000
<font size="35">I need to show all the other members that I have my dignity as captain</font>

92
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,500
<font size="35">-You can see her resolve</font>

93
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,250
<font size="35">-It's impressive</font>

94
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:13,000
<font size="35">So I'm going to try my best!</font>

95
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:18,000
<font size="35">First to challenge the jump will be the appointed member, Sakurai</font>

96
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,750
<font size="35">But if Sakurai is unable to jump, Takayama will be forced to substitute</font>

97
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:27,500
<font size="35">By the way, if the worst should happen</font>

98
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,250
<font size="35">You're covered by our insurance</font>

99
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:32,000
<font size="35">What do you think is going to happen to us?!</font>

100
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:36,000
<font size="35">In the event that Sakurai dies</font>

101
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,000
<font size="35">You're covered for 10 million yen</font>

102
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
<font size="25">{\an8}[T/L: It's not that much, about Â£60,000]</font>

103
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
<font size="35">Oh my god, it's actually written down!</font>

104
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
<font size="35">And if you're injured your hospital fees are covered</font>

105
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:52,750
<font size="35">If you invest that 10 million yen into the single it'll probably sell</font>

106
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:56,250
<font size="35">Wait, stop, this is insane!</font>

107
00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:04,500
<font size="35">This time, Akimoto will return Sakurai's favour from the previous campaign and support Takayama and Sakurai</font>

108
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,000
<font size="35">However, Tsubokura has an unsettling message for the wavering Sakurai</font>

109
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:15,000
<font size="35">In an hour and a half ordinary customers will start using this spot again</font>

110
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,250
<font size="35">We've only rented it for that long</font>

111
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,000
<font size="35">In an hour and a half people will start showing up</font>

112
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
<font size="35">So if you don't jump then this will all have been futile</font>

113
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,750
<font size="35">Wow, the pressure!</font>

114
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:28,500
<font size="35">The engineer who had to come 3 hours from Tokyo</font>

115
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,750
<font size="35">The feelings of the staff who got things ready</font>

116
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
<font size="35">And the money spent on renting this place</font>

117
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:36,250
<font size="35">That's right!</font>

118
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:40,000
<font size="35">Think very carefully about the effort that was put in while you jump</font>

119
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
<font size="35">This is weird, you are you pressuring me so hard?!</font>

120
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,750
<font size="35">Feeling pressure from all sides, Sakurai prepared to jump</font>

121
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,750
<font size="35">This looks super scary right?</font>

122
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,250
<font size="35">The other members wait under the bridge, waiting and believing in their captain</font>

123
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:03,000
<font size="35">If Sakurai fails to jump, a compulsory jump awaits Takayama</font>

124
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:07,500
<font size="35">With the weight of the success of the single on her back</font>

125
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
<font size="35">She looks down from the 42 metre high jump platform</font>

126
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
<font size="35">Wah, wait, wait, this is too scary!</font>

127
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,500
<font size="35">-Woah, amazing</font>

128
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,500
<font size="35">Jumping from here, you'd really mean it</font>

129
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,250
<font size="35">-Sakurai, how's the view?</font>

130
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:20,750
<font size="35">Sakurai, how's the view?</font>

131
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:23,750
<font size="35">It's scary, scary, way too scary!</font>

132
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:28,750
<font size="35">No, I can't do it!</font>

133
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,500
<font size="35">-This is properly scary</font>

134
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,000
<font size="35">This is properly scary</font>

135
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,500
<font size="35">But you'll all have to do this at some point</font>

136
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
<font size="35">Come on, you can do it Reika!</font>

137
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:43,000
<font size="35">After this, please go in your own time</font>

138
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:46,750
<font size="35">In your own time, please step forward</font>

139
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:50,000
<font size="35">And then, make sure to say</font>

140
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
<font size="35">"To make Girl's Rule a massive hit!"</font>

141
00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:00,500
<font size="35">And then jump!</font>

142
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:04,000
<font size="35">What are the members going to do for Sakurai, who can't seem to jump?</font>

143
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,250
<font size="35">Everyone raise your voice and let's help her out!</font>

144
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:06,250
<font size="35">Yes!</font>

145
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:08,000
<font size="35">-What's up with this old geezer?</font>

00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,000
<font size="35">Who is he trying to be?</font>

148
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,500
<font size="35">-We could say "Go for it captain!"</font>

149
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,500
<font size="35">We could say "Go for it captain!"</font>

150
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:15,500
<font size="35">And then how about "Hop, step and bungee!"?</font>

151
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,000
<font size="35">Let's go!</font>

152
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,500
<font size="35">Go for it captain!</font>

153
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:23,000
<font size="35">Hop, step and bungee!</font>

154
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
<font size="35">However, Sakurai who was receiving this support was...</font>

155
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:37,000
<font size="35">Wait, this is scary, what should I do, I can't do this, wait, I can't jump, I really can't do anything!!</font>

156
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,500
<font size="35">As a result of Sakurai being stuck like this for over 20 minutes</font>

157
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:44,000
<font size="35">Tsubokura had to speak up</font>

158
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
<font size="35">A lot of staff are working on this</font>

159
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,500
<font size="35">I'm sorry, I know</font>

160
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:52,000
<font size="35">If you don't jump, Nogizaka46</font>

161
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
<font size="35">Might have to break up</font>

162
00:08:55,500 --> 00:09:01,000
<font size="35">No way!</font>

163
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
<font size="35">Come on Reika!</font>

164
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,500
<font size="35">Reika~</font>

165
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,750
<font size="35">If the worst comes to the worst</font>

166
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,750
<font size="35">Takayama is standing by and ready</font>

167
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,750
<font size="35">Do it for me Reika!</font>

168
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:11,750
<font size="35">Reika!</font>

169
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:15,000
<font size="35">Don't forget, everyone believes in you!</font>

170
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,750
<font size="35">She's never really solved any of our problems</font>

171
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:20,500
<font size="35">Captain Sakurai, up until now no-one can say they trust her absolutely</font>

172
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:23,500
<font size="35">If Nogizaka's going to change, the captain needs to do this</font>

173
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,000
<font size="35">I see, I see!</font>

174
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,500
<font size="35">This bungee jump is the perfect chance to show a captain's abilities</font>

175
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:34,000
<font size="35">Will she be successful, and win the member's respect?</font>

176
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,500
<font size="35">5, 4, 3, 2, 1, Bungee!</font>

177
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,500
<font size="35">I can't do it, I'm going back!</font>

178
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,500
<font size="35">I can't, I can't, I can't!</font>

179
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,500
<font size="35">I can't, I can't, it was impossible after all!</font>

180
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
<font size="35">It's scary, it's too scary!</font>

181
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:58,000
<font size="35">Sakurai, who couldn't overcome her fear, collapsed and couldn't get back up</font>

182
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
<font size="35">What happened?</font>

183
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,500
<font size="35">-It's scary~</font>

184
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,000
<font size="35">It's scary~</font>

185
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
<font size="35">-Is it impossible for you?</font>

186
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:01,500
<font size="35">Is it impossible for you?</font>

187
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,500
<font size="35">It's really too scary</font>

188
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,500
<font size="35">-Really too scary?</font>

189
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:03,500
<font size="35">Really too scary?</font>

190
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,000
<font size="35">-It's really too scary, way too scary!</font>

191
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,250
<font size="35">It's really too scary, way too scary!</font>

192
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:07,500
<font size="35">-Well, it definitely looks scary from here</font>

193
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,250
<font size="35">Well, it definitely looks scary from here</font>

194
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:10,250
<font size="35">What should we do then?</font>

195
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:10,750
<font size="35">Reika~</font>

196
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:11,750
<font size="35">-Can you try one more time?</font>

197
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:12,500
<font size="35">Can you try one more time?</font>

198
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,750
<font size="35">Nnnn, I can't</font>

199
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:15,000
<font size="35">Is it impossible?</font>

200
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,500
<font size="35">-Nonono</font>

201
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,750
<font size="35">Shall we get Takayama to substitute for you?</font>

202
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:23,500
<font size="35">If Sakurai abandons her duty here, the dreaded jump will pass to Takayama</font>

203
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:28,000
<font size="35">What will Captain Sakurai's decision be?</font>

204
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
<font size="35">Do you want to substitute?</font>

205
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:35,000
<font size="35">No way! Is this for real?</font>

206
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,500
<font size="35">-That tiny nod! You gave up so meekly</font>

207
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,250
<font size="35">That tiny nod! You gave up so meekly</font>

208
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:42,500
<font size="35">REIKA!! THIS HAS TO BE A LIE!!</font>

209
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:48,500
<font size="35">Sakurai's spirit cracked and she quit, now it's Takayama's turn!</font>

210
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,250
<font size="35">Was it scary?</font>

211
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:55,000
<font size="35">It was really scary, even though I know I should have gone</font>

212
00:10:55,250 --> 00:11:01,250
<font size="35">When I was supposed to jump off I could let go off the hand rail</font>

213
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:01,250
<font size="35">It was scary?</font>

214
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:02,500
<font size="35">-Too scary</font>

215
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:06,250
<font size="35">When she was asked to switch with Takayama she just gave a tiny nod</font>

216
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:10,500
<font size="35">I don't believe this</font>

217
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,750
<font size="35">Even though it was a good opportunity for her</font>

218
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:17,500
<font size="35">It was her chance to act like a captain</font>

219
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,750
<font size="35">She really should have done it</font>

220
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:24,000
<font size="35">Because the captain wussed out, Takayama headed to the platform</font>

221
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
<font size="35">How did this happen?</font>

222
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:30,000
<font size="35">Hah, isn't this too scary? I can't do it!</font>

223
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
<font size="35">Takayama, can you perform this jump and make the single a hit?</font>

224
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,250
<font size="35">No, wait! I can't!</font>

225
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:38,250
<font size="35">Go for it Kazumin!</font>

226
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,500
<font size="35">You're even worse than your captain</font>

227
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,250
<font size="35">Reika! Why you...!</font>

228
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:42,250
<font size="35">How is it?</font>

229
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:44,000
<font size="35">-Reika, this is horrible!</font>

230
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
<font size="35">Reika, this is horrible!</font>

231
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:48,000
<font size="35">Well, it is really scary</font>

232
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
<font size="35">I think anyone would be freaked out by that</font>

233
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,500
<font size="35">Just a bit further forward, the assistant's right behind you</font>

234
00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:00,500
<font size="35">My legs, my legs won't stop shaking!</font>

235
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,000
<font size="35">In your own time, please</font>

236
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,750
<font size="35">You really need to jump yourself</font>

237
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,500
<font size="35">Wait, wait, aaargh!!</font>

238
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:08,250
<font size="35">Takayama's amazing isn't she</font>

239
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:11,500
<font size="35">Yaaah, what the heck?!</font>

240
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
<font size="35">Tell me this isn't real</font>

241
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,250
<font size="35">Takayama's screams were filling the air</font>

242
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:22,000
<font size="35">But no jump came, and time was fast running out</font>

243
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,750
<font size="35">I can't do this with one leg shaking</font>

244
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:27,000
<font size="35">Takayama, there's no time for this</font>

245
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,750
<font size="35">.....No, I can't do it!!</font>

246
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:33,000
<font size="35">I can't believe this, is everyone going to back out?</font>

247
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:35,250
<font size="35">What are you people doing?</font>

248
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:36,000
<font size="35">You can do it!</font>

249
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:36,250
<font size="35">-Reika, Reika!</font>

250
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:36,750
<font size="35">Reika, Reika!</font>

251
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:37,000
<font size="35">-What, what?</font>

252
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:37,850
<font size="35">What, what?</font>

253
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:39,850
<font size="35">Nonononono, make it stop!</font>

254
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:43,000
<font size="35">She just completely collapsed there</font>

255
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:57,000
<font size="35">After an even shorter time than Sakurai, Takayama just collapsed and gave up</font>

256
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:58,000
<font size="35">Takayama, what happened?</font>

257
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
<font size="35">-Yes</font>

258
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,250
<font size="35">But while I was watching you</font>

259
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:04,000
<font size="35">I thought that your captain looked more likely to jump</font>

260
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
<font size="35">It looked like your lower body had turned to jelly</font>

261
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:08,250
<font size="35">Honestly, after watching Kazumin</font>

262
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:12,250
<font size="35">I was thinking that maybe I could do better</font>

263
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
<font size="35">Seriously though, there's no time left</font>

264
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,750
<font size="35">Then, I'm sorry Reika, but</font>

265
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:20,500
<font size="35">Can you try again?</font>

266
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,000
<font size="35">Just once?</font>

267
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
<font size="35">How about it?</font>

268
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,500
<font size="35">I guess I'll have to try again, right?</font>

269
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:25,750
<font size="35">Well then, Sakurai will challenge one more time!</font>

270
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:27,000
<font size="35">-Go for it!</font>

271
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:32,000
<font size="35">And if you can't do it</font>

272
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:34,250
<font size="35">We'll just have to go with Akimoto!</font>

273
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,500
<font size="35">Her reaction just arrived</font>

274
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,500
<font size="35">She has no idea what's going on</font>

275
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,000
<font size="35">Want to give it a shot?</font>

276
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,750
<font size="35">Uh, what are you talking about...?</font>

277
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:44,000
<font size="35">OK Captain, please try one more time</font>

278
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,750
<font size="35">And if you can't</font>

279
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:47,750
<font size="35">We still have Akimoto!</font>

280
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:49,250
<font size="35">I hope I just misheard that</font>

281
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:53,000
<font size="35">The bungee jump for the sake of the single campaign</font>

282
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,750
<font size="35">What will be Sakurai's fate this time round?</font>

283
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:01,000
<font size="35">Picking up a spirit that seemed broken</font>

284
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
<font size="35">Captain Sakurai is going to take on the bungee jump once more!</font>

285
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,250
<font size="35">(Staff member) It looks like Sakurai's going to go</font>

286
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:07,000
<font size="35">-Reika!</font>

287
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
<font size="35">Reika!</font>

288
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:08,000
<font size="35">Reika, you can do it!</font>

289
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
<font size="35">-Sakurai-chan, this is awesome!</font>

290
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:11,500
<font size="35">Sakurai-chan, this is awesome!</font>

291
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,500
<font size="35">And if Sakurai's not able to jump</font>

292
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,750
<font size="35">Akimoto's preparing by filling out her insurance</font>

293
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,000
<font size="35">-Wait, wait, this is just weird</font>

294
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
<font size="35">-Wait, wait, this is just weird</font>

295
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,750
<font size="35">What's with this?</font>

296
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,750
<font size="35">This is totally unfair!</font>

297
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:26,750
<font size="35">He~h, this is really harsh, it's so scary</font>

298
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:28,000
<font size="35">OK, make your statement and jump</font>

299
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:28,500
<font size="35">-I knew it, this is horrible!</font>

300
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,750
<font size="35">I knew it, this is horrible!</font>

301
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:33,500
<font size="35">Ah, she changed out just in case</font>

302
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
<font size="35">It's just weird!</font>

303
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:41,250
<font size="35">You changed just in case, right?</font>

304
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:43,500
<font size="35">Isn't this "just in case" just weird?</font>

305
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,750
<font size="35">You might be needed, though</font>

306
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:48,250
<font size="35">Ugh, come on then captain</font>

307
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:51,500
<font size="35">Last time, Captain Sakurai</font>

308
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,250
<font size="35">It's so tall</font>

309
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:55,250
<font size="35">Failed to jump</font>

310
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:58,500
<font size="35">If you don't jump Reika it'll suck to be me!</font>

311
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
<font size="35">That's for sure</font>

312
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,000
<font size="35">1, 2...</font>

313
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
<font size="35">Come on captain!</font>

314
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:11,250
<font size="35">Now, once again please prepare yourself, captain</font>

315
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
<font size="35">Ha, scary, wait a second</font>

316
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:18,500
<font size="35">Look, you've already let go</font>

317
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,500
<font size="35">See, you can do it!</font>

318
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,750
<font size="35">I can't just yet, this is just practice</font>

319
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:24,250
<font size="35">Yeah, yeah, I know</font>

320
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:26,250
<font size="35">Come on captain!</font>

321
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:28,500
<font size="35">Why are you suddenly cheering so much harder?</font>

322
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,500
<font size="35">But this is scary....</font>

323
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:35,750
<font size="35">Anyway, if you yell "So that Girls' Rule will be a big hit!"</font>

324
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:38,250
<font size="35">If you yell it out loud it should help</font>

325
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:40,000
<font size="35">Use that feeling</font>

326
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,750
<font size="35">Nogizaka46's 6th single!</font>

327
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,750
<font size="35">To make it a big hit!</font>

328
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,000
<font size="35">It's hopeless!</font>

329
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,000
<font size="35">It's no good!</font>

330
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,500
<font size="35">Do you even want the single to sell?!</font>

331
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,250
<font size="35">Facing her frantic fears for the sake of the group, Captain Sakurai</font>

332
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:02,500
<font size="35">But what about the other members?</font>

333
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:04,000
<font size="35">Reika!</font>

334
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
<font size="35">-Look, a train!</font>

335
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:05,500
<font size="35">Look, a train!</font>

336
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:08,000
<font size="35">Cool, a train!</font>

337
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,500
<font size="35">Pff, a train</font>

338
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:13,000
<font size="35">Shouldn't you be more interested in Sakurai-chan than a train?</font>

339
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:17,000
<font size="35">Captain Sakurai, is it really impossible?</font>

340
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,750
<font size="35">Is she going?</font>

341
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,250
<font size="35">Go for it!</font>

342
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,000
<font size="35">There's no time!</font>

343
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,250
<font size="35">Since this morning</font>

344
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:26,500
<font size="35">Lots of adults have been working on this</font>

345
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:31,750
<font size="35">Even I woke up at 4:30 in the morning</font>

346
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,000
<font size="35">4:30?!</font>

347
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:33,500
<font size="35">-They came here wanting to be shown your courage</font>

348
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:36,000
<font size="35">They came here wanting to be shown your courage</font>

349
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:41,250
<font size="35">The camera operator also had to carry a lot of heavy equipment</font>

350
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,500
<font size="35">All the way here</font>

351
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:46,500
<font size="35">We've stretched this out long enough</font>

352
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,500
<font size="35">All there is left is for you to jump</font>

353
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:52,500
<font size="35">Come on Reika!</font>

354
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,500
<font size="35">Jump, you can do it!</font>

355
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,250
<font size="35">Go for it!</font>

356
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,250
<font size="35">Go on!</font>

357
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,250
<font size="35">Jump</font>

358
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,500
<font size="35">Will she give up?</font>

359
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,500
<font size="35">Does Sakurai's nod mean she's made a decision?</font>

360
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,750
<font size="35">Has she decided as captain, to jump for the sake of her comrades?</font>

361
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:23,250
<font size="35">Or perhaps she's decided to pass the responsibility on once again?</font>

362
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,500
<font size="35">Go! Oh, she looks like she's going</font>

363
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,500
<font size="35">5, 4, 3, 2, 1</font>

364
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,000
<font size="35">-Here we go!</font>

365
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,750
<font size="35">So that Nogizaka46's 6th single will be a big hit!</font>

366
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:36,750
<font size="35">-She's really going for it!</font>

367
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:42,500
<font size="35">-She's so cool!</font>

368
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,000
<font size="35">-She really did it!</font>

369
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
<font size="35">-She really did it!</font>

370
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
<font size="35">She really jumped!</font>

371
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:46,500
<font size="35">-I can't believe it!</font>

372
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,500
<font size="35">-I can't believe it!</font>

373
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:49,250
<font size="35">Reika!</font>

374
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:51,000
<font size="35">You look like you're going to cry</font>

375
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:59,000
<font size="35">The members said they thought she was lacking as a captain</font>

376
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,750
<font size="35">But when it came to the feeling of loving Nogizaka46</font>

377
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:05,250
<font size="35">She believes she wouldn't lose to anyone!</font>

378
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:08,500
<font size="35">And most of all she wants this single to be a success</font>

379
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:12,000
<font size="35">With that strength of that feeling she conquered the fearsome bungee jump</font>

380
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
<font size="35">For the sake of her comrades, and her self-belief</font>

381
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
<font size="35">Sakurai took a massive step forward</font>

382
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:23,000
<font size="35">It was awesome!</font>

383
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,000
<font size="35">So awesome</font>

384
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:31,000
<font size="35">And scary too!</font>

385
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
<font size="35">She still going</font>

386
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,500
<font size="35">This is excellent!</font>

387
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,500
<font size="35">Reika!</font>

388
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:43,750
<font size="35">-Yes~</font>

389
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:44,750
<font size="35">Yes~</font>

390
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:49,000
<font size="35">That was amazing!</font>

391
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:02,000
<font size="35">You might not like it now, but that was seriously amazing</font>

392
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,250
<font size="35">She's still crying</font>

393
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,000
<font size="35">Are you OK?</font>

394
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,500
<font size="35">Mmmnnnn</font>

395
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,000
<font size="35">How was it?</font>

396
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,250
<font size="35">Your first bungee jump?</font>

397
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:15,250
<font size="35">It was horrifying!</font>

398
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,500
<font size="35">Do you feel more confident than before?</font>

399
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,250
<font size="35">She's cute!</font>

400
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:22,500
<font size="35">-It was scary right?</font>

401
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,250
<font size="35">She really is cute</font>

402
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:25,750
<font size="35">What do you think of your captain now?</font>

403
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:27,750
<font size="35">She's really cool!</font>

404
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,500
<font size="35">You all look moved</font>

405
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:31,750
<font size="35">You really did well</font>

406
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,500
<font size="35">What did you all think?</font>

407
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,250
<font size="35">It was so moving!</font>

408
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:46,500
<font size="35">I thought I was going to cry when I did this too</font>

409
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,000
<font size="35">You were great</font>

410
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,250
<font size="35">Did you all feel your captain's greatness?</font>

411
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:51,750
<font size="35">We felt it!</font>

412
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:53,500
<font size="35">Has it changed your view of her?</font>

413
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,000
<font size="35">Up until this point</font>

414
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
<font size="35">That image of a capable captain</font>

415
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
<font size="35">She never had it</font>

416
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,750
<font size="35">But today was really different</font>

417
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:04,000
<font size="35">She really tried her best for all of us</font>

418
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
<font size="35">And when I saw her jump for the 6th single</font>

419
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:11,500
<font size="35">I felt that I can be relaxed and trust her from now on</font>

420
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,250
<font size="35">The 6th single "Girls' Rule"'s campaign was...</font>

421
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:18,000
<font size="35">A total success!</font>

422
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
<font size="35">Yee-ay!</font>

423
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,500
<font size="35">That was awesome!</font>

424
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:26,000
<font size="35">I thought you'd do it, but well done!</font>

425
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,250
<font size="35">You gave it your all</font>

426
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
<font size="35">It must have been scary though, standing up there</font>

427
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,750
<font size="35">It was really frightening</font>

428
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:35,500
<font size="35">It really looked that way</font>

429
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,750
<font size="35">I felt a strange pressure</font>

430
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:38,750
<font size="35">Before you jumped?</font>

431
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:39,250
<font size="35">-That's right</font>

432
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:39,500
<font size="35">That's right</font>

433
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:40,250
<font size="35">-When you're about to jump your body starts feeling heavy</font>

434
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:43,000
<font size="35">When you're about to jump your body starts feeling heavy</font>

435
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,750
<font size="35">That was scary, I don't ever want to do it again</font>

436
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
<font size="35">First time round though, you gave up and passed it on to Takayama</font>

437
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,250
<font size="35">You still don't get why?</font>

438
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:54,250
<font size="35">I was already terrified</font>

439
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:55,000
<font size="35">-There are people who can't do it</font>

440
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:55,750
<font size="35">There are people who can't do it</font>

441
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:56,000
<font size="35">-I thought I probably couldn't</font>

442
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
<font size="35">I thought I probably couldn't</font>

443
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
<font size="35">But there was still time so I went</font>

444
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,250
<font size="35">Your legs just freeze up, right?</font>

445
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:03,250
<font size="35">-That can happen</font>

446
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:04,250
<font size="35">That can happen</font>

447
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:07,500
<font size="35">You're just staggering like this, up to the last moment</font>

448
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:10,000
<font size="35">If you stumble even a little, you'll fall</font>

449
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,500
<font size="35">That's actually what we wanted to see, though</font>

450
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,000
<font size="35">That would have been good</font>

451
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,250
<font size="35">We should have recorded that</font>

452
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:23,000
<font size="35">The thing is the longer Reika took</font>

453
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
<font size="35">The more I understood her fear</font>

454
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,500
<font size="35">And I wanted to share what she was feeling</font>

455
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:30,000
<font size="35">Was a new bond formed between you two?</font>

456
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,500
<font size="35">Next time should we send you somewhere haunted then?</font>

457
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:43,000
<font size="35">Coming up, the 6th single's coupling song will debut in the studio</font>

458
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,000
<font size="35">The new single coupling song</font>

459
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:46,250
<font size="35">"Sekai de Ichiban Kodoroku na Lover" is debuting now!</font>

460
00:21:46,250 --> 00:24:03,250
<font size="25">{\an8}[T/L: "Loneliest Lover in the World"]</font>

461
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:07,500
<font size="35">Coming up next, a familial squabble will boil over!</font>

462
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:13,500
<font size="35">Nogizaka46's midsummer national tour</font>

463
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:19,000
<font size="35">As soon as this episode is finished, the ticket allocation will start on the group's mobile site</font>

464
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:22,500
<font size="35">Please check the site for more details</font>

465
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
<font size="35">Next week, a great meeting of all the members!</font>

466
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:31,500
<font size="35">Former AKB member Noro Kayo</font>

467
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:34,500
<font size="35">Will give this familial meeting a lecture on surviving showbusiness</font>

468
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,500
<font size="35">Huh, it should be Marika</font>

469
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:40,100
<font size="35">And the group's anger will be dragged out!</font>

470
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:40,200
<font size="25">{\an8}[Is this what it means to be a big idol family?]</font>

471
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:54,000
<font size="25">{\an8}[Do a lot of members mean a lot of problems?]</font>

472
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:59,500
<font size="35">Noro-sensei will show them the demon's path!</font>
