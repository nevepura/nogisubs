61

<font size="49"><b>Alright. "My approachable appearance"</b></font>

62
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:12,160
<font size="49"><b>No way.</b></font>

63
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:12,530

64
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:13,850
<font size="49" color="#d9c9e5"><b>Your appearance?</b></font>

68

<font size="49"><b>I see.</b></font>

73

74
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:35,140
<font size="49"><b>Is there anyone here who thinks she won't lose in terms of being approachable?</b></font>

<font face="Arial Black" size="53">Step forward! Step forward!</font>

76
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,460

77
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:38,980
<font size="49"><b>Yes.</b></font>

78
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:39,660
<font size="49"><b>Is that so?</b></font>

79
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:44,010
<font size="49"><b>I'm really. Really. I'm actually the opposite and I never get shy around people.</b></font>

80
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:47,560
<font size="49"><b>So 100% for sure I can get along with anyone I've just met.</b></font>

81
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,020
<font size="49"><b>That's quite clever.</b></font>

82
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:54,180
<font size="49"><b>When I first talked to everyone in Nogizaka when the group was just formed...</b></font>

<font size="49"><b>Eh?</b></font>

85
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:57,580

86
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:00,150
<font size="49"><b>Ah so she was hard to approach?</b></font>

87
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:00,980
<font size="49"><b>Yes.</b></font>

88
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:01,460
<font size="49"><b>Like...</b></font>

89
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:02,300
<font size="49"><b>So Yuttan is lying?</b></font>

90
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:03,350
<font size="49"><b>Yuttan isn't lying!</b></font>

91
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:05,320
<font size="49"><b>I didn't think she looked very approachable...</b></font>

92
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,270
<font size="49"><b>Why?</b></font>

93
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:06,860
<font size="49"><b>She looked quite headstrong?</b></font>

94
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:07,860
<font size="49" color="#d9c9e5"><b>Just wait.</b></font>

95
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:09,880
<font size="49"><b>Just after it was said that you don't get many chances like this...</b></font>

96
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,230
<font size="49"><b>It's the worst when you get told something awful, huh?</b></font>

97
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:13,460
<font size="49"><b>Let's move on.</b></font>

98
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:14,610
<font size="49"><b>Matsumura.</b></font>

99
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:16,180
<font size="49"><b>Do you remember this?</b></font>

100
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:17,520
<font size="49"><b>I don't remember at all.</b></font>

101
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:20,700
<font size="49"><b>I see. Matsumura's answer to this question is this.</b></font>

102
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:24,450
<font size="49"><b>My chest as seen from the top when I'm wearing a bra.</b></font>

103
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,410
<font size="49"><b>Eh!!</b></font>

104
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:30,980
<font size="49"><b>Why... I wonder why this wasn't picked?</b></font>

105
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:35,290
<font size="49"><b>Eh, this... Really... Well, we wear bras right.</b></font>

106
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:38,200
<font size="49"><b>Then I peek inside my clothes from the top like this.</b></font>

107
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:41,720
<font size="49"><b>And my chest as seen from the top like that is really cute.</b></font>

108
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,680
<font size="49"><b>Cute?</b></font>

109
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:44,560
<font size="49"><b>So it's cute.</b></font>

110
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,360
<font size="49"><b>I see.</b></font>

111
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,040
<font size="49"><b>This is quite an answer, isn't it?</b></font>

112
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,690
<font size="49"><b>It's true. Shiraishi Mai-chan also always says it's cute.</b></font>

113
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:52,650
<font size="49"><b>Eh, so you show her? You said it was cute?</b></font>

114
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:53,650
<font size="49"><b>I did.</b></font>

115
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:55,910
<font size="49"><b>So because she said it, you wrote this?</b></font>

116
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:57,070
<font size="49"><b>But she usually says so.</b></font>

117
00:04:57,070 --> 00:05:02,190
<font size="49"><b>Yes. I kind of really... I kind of really like looking at myself from the top like this.</b></font>

118
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:03,900
<font size="49"><b>So, usually, I...</b></font>

119
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:03,900
<font size="49"><b>No, no. It's not like that...</b></font>

120
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,910
<font size="49" color="#d9c9e5"><b>What's that like?</b></font>

121
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:08,420
<font size="49"><b>Eh, how do I say this...</b></font>

122
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:10,330
<font size="49"><b>But Sayurin, you're quite flat, aren't you?</b></font>

123
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:11,970
<font size="49"><b>No!!</b></font>

124
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:14,300
<font size="49"><b>Sayurin is cute because she's flat.</b></font>

125
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:17,250
<font size="49"><b>Eh, so you're flat? This seems like something that someone more endowed would say though.</b></font>

126
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,740
<font size="49"><b>Actually, I really am just a tad bit small...</b></font>

127
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:21,100
<font size="49"><b>It's not a tad bit.</b></font>

128
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:26,100
<font size="49"><b>Is there anyone here who would say they won't lose in terms of chest size?</b></font>

129
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:29,030
<font size="49"><b>Ah, as expected, it's difficult to assert yourself with this topic.</b></font>

130
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:30,410
<font size="49"><b>Then maybe I should assert myself first.</b></font>

131
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:31,410
<font size="49"><b>No need.</b></font>

132
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:34,810
<font size="49"><b>It's true. It's true though.</b></font>

<font size="49"><b>So, how do we... Can we have camera 2 take a peek?</b></font>

134
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:38,420

00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:40,120
<font size="49"><b>No, no, that's not allowed.</b></font>

136
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,380
<font size="49"><b>No, no.</b></font>

137
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:44,250
<font size="49"><b>Then, shall we continue? Next is Hashimoto.</b></font>

138

139
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:52,650

140
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,420
<font size="49"><b>Amazing.</b></font>

141
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:56,490
<font size="49"><b>That's true!</b></font>

142
00:05:56,490 --> 00:06:01,000
<font size="49"><b>What is this? So when you say work, I guess there's... Variety.</b></font>

143
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,910
<font size="49"><b>And well, there's when you're singing songs, and aside from that I guess your actress voice?</b></font>

144
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:05,580
<font size="49"><b>No, no.</b></font>

145
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:06,810
<font size="49"><b>Well, there's three...</b></font>

146
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:08,050
<font size="49"><b>Tell us the three types.</b></font>

147
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:11,510
<font size="49"><b>One is for when I appear on TV shows like this.</b></font>

148
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:13,120
<font size="49"><b>Another is for handshakes.</b></font>

149
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,130
<font size="49"><b>That's different?</b></font>

150
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:15,450
<font size="49"><b>For handshakes.</b></font>

151
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:19,370
<font size="49"><b>And the next is for narration? For voice-only jobs.</b></font>

152
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:20,120
<font size="49"><b>Actress?</b></font>

153
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,330
<font size="49"><b>Voice only? Like when you need to act with your voice?</b></font>

154
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:23,490
<font size="49"><b>No, no.</b></font>

155
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:26,920
<font size="49"><b>So, then, your voice right now is your TV voice.</b></font>

156
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,550
<font size="49"><b>Yes.</b></font>

157
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:30,170
<font size="49"><b>Right? So when you're doing handshakes, it's different?</b></font>

158
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:32,920
<font size="49"><b>Fans actually say this a lot to me...</b></font>

159
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:36,430
<font size="49"><b>They tell me that my voice is actually higher when they talk to me personally.</b></font>

160
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:40,910
<font size="49"><b>Do you do that consciously? Like you tell yourself I'm going with my handshake voice now?</b></font>

161
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:42,380
<font size="49"><b>It's probably more unconsciously...</b></font>

162
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:43,390
<font size="49"><b>Ah, so you do it unconsciously.</b></font>

163
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:46,220
<font size="49"><b>But well, we have to talk to a lot of people for a long time then.</b></font>

164
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:51,790
<font size="49"><b>Kazumin also says this. In order not to hurt our throats, we make our voice a little higher, it's not falsetto, but...</b></font>

165
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:53,440
<font size="49"><b>Eh? Can you do it? Like "Hello." Hello.</b></font>

166
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,550
<font size="49" color="#d9c9e5"><b>Wait, it's embarrassing.</b></font>

167
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:55,550

175
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:10,430
<font size="49"><b>Ah, it's high!</b></font>

176
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,860
<font size="49"><b>Okay do your usual voice. Usual voice.</b></font>

180
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:15,710
<font size="49"><b>Wow.</b></font>

181

183
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:19,950

188
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,620
<font size="49"><b>So for narration?</b></font>

189
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:31,400
<font size="49"><b>When I do narrations, I try to make my voice higher in a good way.</b></font>

190
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,380

191
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:35,650
<font size="49"><b>How was it with narrations you've done in the past?</b></font>

192
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:38,660

201
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:55,120
<font size="49"><b>It didn't sound like that, did it?</b></font>

237
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,270
