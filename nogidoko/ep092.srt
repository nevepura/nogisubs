00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:20,900
Hmmm? Who is that, the one on the 2nd row? Third person?

17
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:25,120
Wait... 2nd row huh? Who are you?

18
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:28,900

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,940
So, who are you?

20
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,200
Noujou Ami!

21
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,920
- Your hair is very different!
- Noujou?

22
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:38,440
Your hairstyle seem different...

23
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,740
Is it?

24
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:50,100
Himura, please announce the topic tonight
with a loud voice that all can hear!

25
00:01:50,340 --> 00:02:01,200
To be able to survive a harsh entertainment world,
big group idol's group learning of "happenings".

26
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:13,720
Tonight, doesn't matter whether senbatsu or UG, as a big group of idol,
They have to tell their happenings that they experienced, to make a tighter union.

27
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:17,160
And tonight's guest is...

28
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,420
Start the topic?

29
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,760
Yes, I think we should ignore the guest this time.

30
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,020
Ok, lets start!

31
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:26,900
It's cruel. Please call me!

32
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:29,500
It's starting, so please be quiet.

33
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:33,960
I do think I am important guest for them.

34
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:36,260
You should call me.

35
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,260
So the guest is that oldman?

36
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:41,580
Wait a sec, that person is my manager.

37
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:43,720
A big manager.

38
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,640
Big manager?

39
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,480
He's called Demon Hama.

40
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:49,740
Demon Hama?

41
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:52,700
Demon Hama, please forgive us.

42
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:58,000
Tonight, she will act as a teacher. Noro Kayo-sensei.

43
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,220
Please pardon me.

44
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:03,620
You Know a lot of happenings right?

45
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:05,740
I've been in 2 group.

46
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:12,700
Ex AKB48 and SDN48, further more, she was a captain in SDN48.

47
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:16,680
Yes, thats why I know all your feeling.

48
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:21,320
I intent to help you all.

49
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,220
That means you will give a lot of advise for them right?
But, please talk only if I give the chance.

50
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:27,980
AAAA, like that huh!!??

51
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:33,280
So, the 1st happening is this!

52
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,240
Wrong name...

53
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:39,240
- This is very plausible.
- Who wrote this?

54
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,400
Thats me!

55
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,580
- Oh, Wada!
- Wada Maaya. It's been a while!

56
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,900
- Yes.
- What is this mean?

57
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:50,680
At event, fans calling" Maaya Maaya".

58
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,280
Oh Maaya Maaya.

59
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,700
I am so happy and wave my hands for reply.

60
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:56,640
That's good!

61
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:05,300
But when I observe more, they are not waving their hands for me
and when I see my side, there is Maiyan, Shiraishi Mai.

62
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,940
Not Maaya but Maiyan!

63
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:11,420
So I made a mistake.

64
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,200
If you see from fans' point of view, they wont understand your action.

65
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,580
"Maiyan Maiyan" and you waving your hand to them.

66
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:24,000
Too bad for you... Only because you have a similar name.

67
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,000
So this kind of happening is occuring a lot in a group?

68
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:34,620
Yes! And if you are in the front row, you wont notice
whether they wave their hand for you or at back person.

69
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:35,280
I see.

70
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:39,480
Especially for non-senbatsu, this matter is an "issue" for them.

71
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,200
I see.

72
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:42,620
So you should make a confirmation first
by seeing your surounding first.

73
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,560
Confim and reply.

74
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,580
Yes, confirm that it's for you then reply.

75
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,360
Fabulous it is so correct.

76
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,540
And there's alot of same family name right?

77
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:54,040
Yes it is.

78
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,600
"Saitou" problem.

79
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:03,280
Saitou... Theres 18 Saitou(s) right.

80
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,540
Is there any problem?

81
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:07,780
Kanji for "SAI" in Saitou is different one to other.

82
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:13,140
But in the script, i never see my name is written correctly.

83
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,300
So it would be better if I said "that SAI".

84
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,280
- Yes.
- That's correct.

85
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:19,820
I see, a small problem but...

86
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,100
A small problem but it hurts.

87
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:28,280
As for me, my name is Noro(v) but they always said Noro(^).

88
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,780
EH! so the correct one is Noro(v)

89
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:32,620
- Yes the correct one is Noro(v) Kayo.
- So it's same with "NORO" Virus?

90
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,280
When we say norovirus is noro(v) right?

91
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,060
Yes that noro(v).

92
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,500
Like "norakuro"' nora? (Wiki: NORAKURO)

93
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:38,520
That's completely wrong!
Like "norakuro"' nora? (Wiki: NORAKURO)

94
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:41,040
That's completely wrong!

95
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,520
Boro Car? (Boro = wrecked)

96
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,060
Noro(v)

97
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,800
The correct is Noro(v).

98
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:53,940
Why you all doing this gesture?

99
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:54,940
Its like saying "NODO"(NODO = throat)

100
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:56,520
Yes...

101
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:58,680
Nodo!

102
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,360
Not Nodo.

103
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,680
NODOKAYO (Just Throat)!!

104
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:06,280
Other name?

105
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:07,480
Name problem...

106
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,580
Itou!

107
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:13,060
My Itou's character is same with Nene.

108
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,680
So is there any mistake?

109
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:21,220
Usually the work schedule is sent by mail,
and i will go according to it.

110
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:25,820
At that time, I was back at Gifu,
and for work I need to go to Tokyo.

111
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:29,960
And the staff just "EH! It should be Marika..."

112
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:34,320
That's cruel!

113
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,740
So they called different person.

114
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,480
This is the staff's mistake!

115
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:41,840
That is cruel!

116
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:51,740
Schedule is being told by mail. Usually they use our first name
"Marika" but that time it's different.

117
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,940
And then?

118
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:57,880
They called Marika in a rush and me at my Tokyo house.

119
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:04,480
But... I feel uncomfortable with Nene... What to do?

120
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:10,160
Only for name there are lots of happenings, today we have alot!

121
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:12,660
Next happening is this!

122
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,300
Hmm? Trying hard to wrap legs together.

123
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:18,840
I don't understand...

124
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,260
Who is this? What's the meaning?

125
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:26,640
If you sit like this, your legs will spread wide open.

126
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,280
STOP it... Wait a sec, it's not captured by camera.

127
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,640
Reply it from closed condition.

128
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,720
So what is it?

129
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,880
Sit like this and...

130
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:35,960
You are closing your legs right?

131
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:39,880
They just loosen.

132
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,680
And, I do understand that we have to keep it closed but...

133
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:47,360
That's right!

134
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:51,180
But, is it only your problem? not for all right?

135
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:55,600
This is a private problem...
your legs are easily to get loosen right?

136
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:01,700
And then when we sit at Nogidoko for senbatsu announcement,
we sit with 2, 3 rows right?

137
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:08,100
Senbatsu will be sitting on 1st row
and we UG are sitting at 3rd row.

138
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,500
So when they're called, your legs is being shot.

139
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,200
we are betting it all on the legs.

140
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:18,540
I want to show beautiful legs.

141
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:22,300
I understand!

142
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:23,260
But it's opened?

143
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:25,880
When I watching the show on TV...

144
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,540
How is it?

145
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,180
WHAM!

146
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,360
This happening, you all feels the same?

147
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:32,980
Yes.

148
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,760
So female also open their legs?

149
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,340
Yes...

150
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:37,500
So you are now keeping your legs together?

151
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,720
With all power.

152
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:43,720
That's correct, if it's break time,
you all showing your panty right.

153
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,680
NO NO NO NO

154
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,140
So this is a common thing?

155
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:54,500
Yes. Especially the one who is sitting on the back row.

156
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,060
You have to close it?

157
00:08:57,060 --> 00:09:01,700
Yes. Cause it won't even be a fanservice.

158
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,000
So we have to try harder?

159
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,340
Yes, try harder.

160
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:07,840
Why don't you tie it with a skin-coloured gumtape.

161
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,860
Lets go to the next thing, next is this!

162
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,060
You appeared as Nogizaka, didn't you?

163
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,420
What's this? who's this?

164
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:19,760
Yes.

165
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,460
Whats the meaning?

166
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:28,220
My hometown is a village, so whenever I get back, my grandma
always saying, you appeared as nogizaka didn't you.

167
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:30,120
- She always said that.
- It's happy thing!

168
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,940
I didn't sing, moreover I didn't appeared.

169
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:39,500
No no no, you don't know it right!

170
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:42,380
You maybe appeared.

171
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:47,200
No, she said "Hina-chan, you appeared as Nogizaka, it's good"
She always praising me.

172
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,060
But... I didn't!

173
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:52,460
No no, you just don't know.

174
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,800
You don't know that!

175
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,180
Maybe you did appear.

176
00:09:55,220 --> 00:10:00,840
No, COMPLETELY DIDNT APPEAR.

177
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:05,140
I see. This is a very likely UG problem...

178
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,980
UG is good.

179
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,720
UG's good.

180
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,800
US's GOOD!

181
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:10,800
I do understand that.

182
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:18,500
I usually see Nogizaka46 at CM and Mags.

183
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:21,160
Wait a sec...

184
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,300
You are NOGIZAKA46.

185
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:23,480
You are NOGIZAKA46!

186
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:30,800
Yes I do but, I see it alot, like cover page
and I just think "This is great!"

187
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,800
Just lately right...

188
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:34,340
Nishino is doing solo gravure at mags.

189
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:41,420
Yes, I do think she's cute...
But I just... "It is good..."

190
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:44,300
I see, but this can't be helped.

191
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:52,760
But, not only UG, we also, when we are called
for a TV show, they wont put mic on us.

192
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,760
Ah! Pin mic...

193
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,740
Understand that...

194
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:59,540
This is, not only in the group,
this thing also happened to us comedians.

195
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:01,080
Yes it is.

196
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:04,100
Like, why he got a mic and I'm not.

197
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:09,800
That's common. I do understand!

198
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:13,860
So, in that case, we shouldn't talk? or should we talk?

199
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:16,460
This is complicated.

200
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,320
Yeah it is complicated.

201
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:24,200
The truth is, our management just said,
do it, that's a chance, why don't you do it!

202
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,380
Yes, they said that things.

203
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,920
But the reality is... no no we can't do it.

204
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:34,560
We, UG, every recording is a life bet.

205
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:38,780
- That's right!
- I agree.

206
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:47,680
You get your shoot when performing songs or PV, but when the camera
is coming at me, and if i did a mistake, that shoot won't be used.

207
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:49,000
Ah, because of nervous.

208
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,600
Yes... Always like that at the important timing.

209
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:56,520
This is our true story, there's time when we only
could appear at TV once in every year.

210
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:07,580
Then whenever there is a chance, Like batting, I just put
all my strength holding the bat and aiming for the coming ball.

211
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:13,880
But, the one who did that, won't hit the ball. In other word,
the one who put all their strength will miss it.

212
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:25,920
That's why, that person will go against the mood, like when you just only needed to say delicious, that person just saying, what's this! Fried shrimp that I ate yesterday is WAY BETTER!

213
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,000
This is do happened.

214
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,940
All young and inexperienced comedians will do this!

215
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:35,100
They all think this is a chance and play it wrong.

216
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:39,600
You have to be carefull with this...
but you must have the will to hit the ball.

217
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,380
I also learned from you just now.

218
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:43,660
I do things like you said before.

219
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:46,480
I did it with my fullest.

220
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:48,900
The important thing is the will.

221
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,940
- May i said something honestly?
- Please do!

222
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:56,280
I'm selected as senbatsu in all 6 singles.

223
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,860
That's great!

224
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:02,340
But, my scene time is...

225
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:08,200
If you count the total, it's only around less than 1 second.

226
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,600
It should be more than 1 second.

227
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,740
I really don't have any screen time

228
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:26,080
But, this matter, if you're in a group, sometime when you see PV on tv, some people just have a blink, and if you want to see certain member, she's very unlikely to appear.

229
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,380
Acting like a panorama...

230
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:28,340
Panorama?

231
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:29,680
They won't give the focus on us.

232
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,820
Wow, you people are very talkative today.

233
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:33,580
Today is great!

234
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:34,480
But... But...

235
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,780
Here she come!

236
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:45,360
Senbatsu member still have screen time on nogidoko... UG have nothing!

237
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:46,540
They wont even call us.

238
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:54,340
For us, being a senbatsu member is a jealous thing!

239
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:57,620
This is heating up.

240
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:01,680
This kind of learning is rare, this is a good chance.

241
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,060
It can't be helped right?

242
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:08,760
Yes it is. If you dont appreciate for being selected,
member like Inoue will be replaced by others.

243
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:20,420
For front members, 8fukujin, I dont think there will be
a large movement. Only a difference in the numbering.

244
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:27,960
But for the back members (senbatsu) if you show any opening,
you will be overtaken. Furthermore there are 2nd gen.

245
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:34,180
Yes. I dont know about them in details but when I see that side (UG)
and comparing with that side(senbatsu), you people have no big differences.

246
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,460
I see, but I do have big differences (sarcasm for Noro).

247
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:41,440
I do have big differences. No, not like that!

248
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:46,040
I see.

249
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:46,940
I agree with you.

250
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:49,600
I feel something big today.

251
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:54,240
Excuse me, Yuttan is crying because she feels the same.

252
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:56,800
And I didn't get the mic also...

253
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:01,080
I don't think it will be like this.

254
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:04,740
If you said that, we already doing this for 20 years.

255
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,300
You people only in your 2nd year!

256
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:10,420
That's right! You people are being selfish!

257
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:15,140
You have your own TV show!

258
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:20,580
After this, don't know why but Himura is victimized!!

259
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:24,920
Let's continue, the next happening is this!

260
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:29,400
What's this. I did research about myself over net. who is this?

261
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:39,780
I did that research by entering my name or nogizaka,
and it will shows alot of things.

262
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:44,220
When I search it, the result is...

263
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:46,060
Anything that make you shocked?

264
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,580
You see something that attacking you?

265
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:48,000
Yes..

266
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:54,340
But, I think you all search it right,
like the impression of certain tv show.

267
00:15:54,340 --> 00:16:01,080
And like love photos, or any witnesses...
I think some of you lready search this kind of things.

268
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:11,020
And there are other person's entry and lots of it is not correct...

269
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:15,920
This is frightening. You have to make sure
the information is correct or not.

270
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,920
There's a lot of entries of Himura, aren't they?

271
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:18,800
Yes, correct.

272
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,320
Like, he's eating with his foolish face.

273
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:28,220
And like, acting cool... There's alot of
entries with acting cool bla bla bla.

274
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:31,400
Now he's at 7-11 posing cool.

275
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,680
Acting cool at gasoline station.

276
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,000
Yes, I feel the same with you about this matter.

277
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:44,340
Like, when I just want to make payment, others just
why you take out your wallet like that!!!

278
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:49,260
Lunchbox... When he queueing for buying lunchbox,
it said "he queueing with acting cool".

279
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:54,020
This is my character's problems right...

280
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:58,640
But I... I just... Yamato Rina is..

281
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:01,620
Why? Are we friends? (hes reacting for her way of speaking)

282
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:02,840
That's fine.

283
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:05,120
I am really troubled.

284
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:10,980
When I search "Yamato Rina" it just shows
"YAMATO RINA HIMURA YUUKI".

285
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,000
Me too!

286
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,760
And, it seems Yamato Rina and Himura Yuuki is similar.

287
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:20,120
- Your chin shape.
- The chin shape?

288
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:23,320
And according to that site, we are similar.

289
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:26,760
Me too, that site also appear.

290
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:30,140
Your face is similar, something like that? So sorry.

291
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:34,380
And there's polling about yes or no.

292
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:35,780
Ahhh Understand!

293
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:37,400
I choose "NO"!

294
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,880
wait a sec...

295
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:44,380
You choose "NO"

296
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:50,200
I click "NO" but 79% people choose "YES".

297
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,060
I see. Right now you are hurting Himura's feeling.

298
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,100
You don't like it do you?

299
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:05,620
After this, because of Hashimoto's comment
Noro is become speechless.

300
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:09,640
Next! the next one is this.

301
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,080
Tan oshi...

302
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:13,280
Tan oshi?

303
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,700
When I think that person is Tan oshi, he went to other lane...

304
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:16,860
Who is this?

305
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:21,220
Yes. Tan oshi is, you only have one pushed member.

306
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,480
So only pushing one member is called tan-oshi.

307
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,580
Yes, and...

308
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:29,340
For me, there are fans that always supporting me from 1st single.

309
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:36,080
That time, when Manatsu is restated back as Nogizaka46,
her lane is next to my lane.

310
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:38,160
Oh, so at handshake all of you is standing next by next?

311
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,580
Yes.

312
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:44,960
That time, the fans who always pushing me is standing at her lane.

313
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:52,160
Ah, so you already know that person is
the same person that always pushing you.

314
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:56,480
Yes, the sad feeling when you see that person
on other lane... lonely feeling.

315
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:01,400
So you remember your fans? like always coming...

316
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,460
Yes I do.

317
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:12,940
We remember, I want to say something for fans,
you think that members not watching you, we did watch you.

318
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:16,980
Even though you queue at a very far lane,
I'm like "ah that person queueing at that lane!"

319
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,220
It's like that?

320
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:27,760
Maybe that person doesn't realize,
but I do want to make that person realized.

321
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,900
And there's someone that change their clothing and queueing at other lane...

322
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:35,000
- That's...
- That person just considering your feeling.

323
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:36,520
It's so sad...

324
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:41,660
Then give a tan-oshi fan a special service.

325
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:43,260
I agree with that.

326
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:45,260
Like giving your hair.

327
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,180
No way!

328
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:50,540
We do want IT!!! YOUR HAIR!

329
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:54,780
Wait wait, what happen? that thing is mine to do.

330
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:58,000
Yes, if there's nothing...

331
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:01,960
If there's nothing, ITS NOT FAIR! GIVE US YOUR HAIR FAST!

332
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,160
Stop it Himura!

333
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:11,020
But if you don't act like that...

334
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,960
It's like a trust.

335
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:23,240
If fans always coming to our lane,
we can trust that person and we feel safe.

336
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:26,040
So this thing is common?

337
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:36,740
Completely common. Like AKB's Fans, especially my fans, there's fans that always pushing me and that person give me a letter stating that he is supporting Nogizaka46 right now.

338
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,160
Only a part of your fans?

339
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:39,440
Yes.

340
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,120
A farewell letter?

341
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:42,120
Yes it is.

342
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:44,980
What to do if this thing happen...

343
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:48,820
But it's free to change your fave right...

344
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:56,300
At the last handshake event,
"I up until now, I always pushing Noro Kayo".

345
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,980
That person.

346
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,620
That person.

347
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:18,060
That person must be the same person, so he just give a word
and apologizing for pushing Noro Kayo.

348
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:19,260
His manner is good but...

349
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:22,060
You won't win against Hashimoto.

350
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:24,680
I won't win against you.

351
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:31,320
I do think he did the correct thing, but please say
"left some of her in the corner of your heart" to him.

352
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,640
Don't forget about Noro Kayo.

353
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,660
Just left some of me in his heart...

354
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:37,320
Interesting.

355
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,720
He said, he really liked you.

356
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:40,720
In that case...

357
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,520
Why he said so much about this.

358
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:48,080
I think it is not a bad thing to move into
next generation, we are getting older...

359
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:51,120
- So from you to them is OK
- Can't be helped

360
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:54,580
So from here to here is...

361
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:57,040
Yes, you're all about the same age right...

362
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,240
Same group...

363
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:06,980
A fans of Mayuyu from AKB48 just came to my place
and reporting to me that Mayuyu like Ikoma.

364
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,080
That kind of excitement is also possible.

365
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:10,400
Like a pigeon post...

366
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,520
That's a bad example...

367
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:16,120
It means that a lot of people just go to a lot of places.

368
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:21,300
Yes, so a lot of girls in same group...

369
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,180
why you are laughing?

370
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,840
why you are laughing?

371
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:30,660
There's still more...
