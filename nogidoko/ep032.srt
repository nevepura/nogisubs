259
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:20,910
<font face="Museo Sans Rounded 700" size="44"><b>Maybe not so much of an embarrassing one.</b></font>

270
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:45,420

272
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:49,140
<font face="Museo Sans Rounded 700" size="44"><b>I will give you this awesome technique.</b></font>

273
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:54,340
<font face="Museo Sans Rounded 700" size="44"><b>When you tell a story, before you reach the most important part: "blablabla and that's when- !"</b></font>

274
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,310
<font face="Museo Sans Rounded 700" size="44"><b>And right there you pause for a second.</b></font>

275
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:01,310

276
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:02,000
<font face="Museo Sans Rounded 700" size="44"><b>Or also</b></font>

277
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,510
<font face="Museo Sans Rounded 700" size="44"><b>For example I was in a panel like that with Nakao Akira and I went like "Nakao-san, that is... !"</b></font>

278
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:12,850
<font face="Museo Sans Rounded 700" size="44"><b>This is Technique</b></font>

279
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:17,200
<font face="Museo Sans Rounded 700" size="44"><b>If you don't advance in your story and talk at lengths</b></font>

280
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,140
<font face="Museo Sans Rounded 700" size="44"><b>It will be cut</b></font>

281
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:20,920
<font face="Museo Sans Rounded 700" size="44"><b>Even if it's somewhat interesting</b></font>

00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:22,280
<font face="Museo Sans Rounded 700" size="44"><b>Woah, I taught them a lot</b></font>

283
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:27,650
<font face="Museo Sans Rounded 700" size="44"><b>But if you try it won't come easy though</b></font>

284
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:30,220
<font face="Museo Sans Rounded 700" size="44"><b>Next one is Matsumura</b></font>

285
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:36,000
<font face="Museo Sans Rounded 700" size="44"><b>After the practice, I started going home with Nanamin</b></font>

286
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,400

289
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:51,710
<font face="Museo Sans Rounded 700" size="44"><b>And with the way Nanamin said it this time, I say "Who was that ?"</b></font>

290
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:56,110
<font face="Museo Sans Rounded 700" size="44"><b>I had absolutely no idea who that old man was.</b></font>

291
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:57,770

292
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:00,850

306
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:30,620

<font face="Museo Sans Rounded 700" size="44"><b>When entering, I rammed my foot pinkie into the corner of the door</b></font>

395
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:25,940
<font face="Museo Sans Rounded 700" size="44"><b>And I had a broken bone.</b></font>

396
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:30,680
<font face="Museo Sans Rounded 700" size="44"><b>It was the day before the school trip</b></font>

397
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,680
<font face="Museo Sans Rounded 700" size="44"><b>The day before the outing? 
- Yes</b></font>

398
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,080
<font face="Museo Sans Rounded 700" size="44"><b>Of course I still had to go to school</b></font>

399
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:38,220
<font face="Museo Sans Rounded 700" size="44"><b>During morning class</b></font>

400
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:42,170
<font face="Museo Sans Rounded 700" size="44"><b>Personally, I was sitting at the most further spot in the class, I couldn't sit there anymore</b></font>

401
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:43,710
<font face="Museo Sans Rounded 700" size="44"><b>There are rules like that ? - Yes</b></font>

402
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:46,910
<font face="Museo Sans Rounded 700" size="44"><b>Then, because I had to do some sort of greeting</b></font>

403
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:51,540
<font face="Museo Sans Rounded 700" size="44"><b>"From now on let's enjoy this outing together" I had to say something like that</b></font>

404
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:56,050
<font face="Museo Sans Rounded 700" size="44"><b>And so I came from the very back, slowly moving forward</b></font>

405
00:16:57,770 --> 00:17:00,510
<font face="Museo Sans Rounded 700" size="44"><b>I said, "Let's all go and have fun"</b></font>

406
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:02,510
<font face="Museo Sans Rounded 700" size="44"><b>It's like discriminating, "Did you come along, too?"</b></font>

407
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,510
<font face="Museo Sans Rounded 700" size="44"><b>Right</b></font>

408
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:08,680
<font face="Museo Sans Rounded 700" size="44"><b>It was so embarassing, I never would have thought it'd be like this</b></font>

409
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:11,120
<font face="Museo Sans Rounded 700" size="44"><b>And the next year</b></font>

410
00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:16,620
<font face="Museo Sans Rounded 700" size="44"><b>This time, after finished club activities,

411
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:18,620
<font face="Museo Sans Rounded 700" size="44"><b>This time I peeled my bones</b></font>

412
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:22,620
<font face="Museo Sans Rounded 700" size="44"><b>And I had to be in a wheelchair</b></font>

413
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:27,770
<font face="Museo Sans Rounded 700" size="44"><b>And again, it was right before the school trip.</b></font>

414
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:30,680
<font face="Museo Sans Rounded 700" size="44"><b>This time, I was chairman of the committee</b></font>

415
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,480
<font face="Museo Sans Rounded 700" size="44"><b>I had to go to say hello to everyone again</b></font>

416
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:36,220
<font face="Museo Sans Rounded 700" size="44"><b>Moreover, since it was a planned school trip,</b></font>

417
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:38,600
<font face="Museo Sans Rounded 700" size="44"><b>They were all waiting in line in front of the station ticket gates</b></font>

418
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:44,280
<font face="Museo Sans Rounded 700" size="44"><b>So I had to come, using my wheelchair in a public place like that...</b></font>

<font face="Museo Sans Rounded 700" size="44"><b>We were taking the train</b></font>

481
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:31,480
<font face="Museo Sans Rounded 700" size="44"><b>At that moment, my mother is next to me, reading a magazine</b></font>

482
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,140
<font face="Museo Sans Rounded 700" size="44"><b>You went with your mother ? - Yes</b></font>

483
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:38,400
<font face="Museo Sans Rounded 700" size="44"><b>However she doesn't usually read magazines on the train, that's quite unusual right ?</b></font>

484
00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:40,620
<font face="Museo Sans Rounded 700" size="44"><b>We wouldn't really know...</b></font>

485
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,620
<font face="Museo Sans Rounded 700" size="44"><b>I think it's quite rare-</b></font>

486
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:44,620
<font face="Museo Sans Rounded 700" size="44"><b>So it's unusual for your mom ? - Yes.</b></font>

487
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:48,400
<font face="Museo Sans Rounded 700" size="44"><b>So I went like "What are you reading~ ?" while gently hitting the magazine.</b></font>

488
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,400
<font face="Museo Sans Rounded 700" size="44"><b>And it turns out, that it wasn't my mom.</b></font>

489
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,540
<font face="Museo Sans Rounded 700" size="44"><b>Eh~ !!</b></font>

490
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:53,020
<font face="Museo Sans Rounded 700" size="44"><b>Seriously ?</b></font>

491
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:55,020
<font face="Museo Sans Rounded 700" size="44"><b>Totally not the right person.</b></font>

492
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:57,200
<font face="Museo Sans Rounded 700" size="44"><b>What happened?</b></font>

493
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,450
<font face="Museo Sans Rounded 700" size="44"><b>I thought she was next to me</b></font>

494
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:00,170
<font face="Museo Sans Rounded 700" size="44"><b>And it wasn't her.</b></font>

495
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:02,850
<font face="Museo Sans Rounded 700" size="44"><b>Without me knowing it, she actually changed seats.</b></font>

496
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:04,850
<font face="Museo Sans Rounded 700" size="44"><b>Ah~ and so you thought that it was your mom ? - That's it</b></font>

497
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:07,250
<font face="Museo Sans Rounded 700" size="44"><b>Where did you hit ?</b></font>

498
00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:08,050
<font face="Museo Sans Rounded 700" size="44"><b>On her magazine</b></font>

499
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:12,110
<font face="Museo Sans Rounded 700" size="44"><b>Her magazine ? While she was reading and you hit it so it fell ?</b></font>

500
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:14,000
<font face="Museo Sans Rounded 700" size="44"><b>No I didn't hit it hard</b></font>

501
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,020
<font face="Museo Sans Rounded 700" size="44"><b>More like a playful "bashi~"</b></font>

502
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:17,020
<font face="Museo Sans Rounded 700" size="44"><b>After that, what happened?</b></font>

503
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:19,020
<font face="Museo Sans Rounded 700" size="44"><b>Since I didn't know what to do at the time,</b></font>

504
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:21,020
<font face="Museo Sans Rounded 700" size="44"><b>I just turned my back and left.</b></font>

505
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:29,140
<font face="Museo Sans Rounded 700" size="44"><b>If I were her, if I was reading a magazine and an unknown woman did that while asking "what are you reading"</b></font>

506
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:31,310
<font face="Museo Sans Rounded 700" size="44"><b>I'd go "Haaaah !?"</b></font>

507
00:22:31,770 --> 00:22:32,450
<font face="Museo Sans Rounded 700" size="44"><b>It's dangerous</b></font>

508
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:35,710
<font face="Museo Sans Rounded 700" size="44"><b>That was super embarassing.</b></font>

509
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:41,250
<font face="Museo Sans Rounded 700" size="44"><b>Alright, everyone got to tell their embarassing and interesting stories</b></font>

510
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:45,540
<font face="Museo Sans Rounded 700" size="44"><b>But so far, everyone has been quite interesting, don't you think ?</b></font>

511
00:22:52,050 --> 00:22:53,370
<font face="Museo Sans Rounded 700" size="44"><b>And we'll end with that,</b></font>

512
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:54,570
<font face="Museo Sans Rounded 700" size="44"><b>Watanabe. - Yes yes</b></font>

513
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:56,970
<font face="Museo Sans Rounded 700" size="44"><b>The story that you find the most interesting today</b></font>

514
00:22:56,970 --> 00:22:58,280
<font face="Museo Sans Rounded 700" size="44"><b>Ah~ the best story.</b></font>

515
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:00,510
<font face="Museo Sans Rounded 700" size="44"><b>All of them were good but,</b></font>

516
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:03,940
<font face="Museo Sans Rounded 700" size="44"><b>Of course today was the comeback of the word "gloomy"</b></font>

517
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:05,600
<font face="Museo Sans Rounded 700" size="44"><b>This is it</b></font>

518
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:08,450
<font face="Museo Sans Rounded 700" size="44"><b>It's been a looong time since I heard that word</b></font>

519
00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:12,510
<font face="Museo Sans Rounded 700" size="44"><b>Saying "suberu" (another version of the word) doesn't have the same effect right ?</b></font>

520
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:15,420
<font face="Museo Sans Rounded 700" size="44"><b>"Isn't the atmosphere a bit gloomy ?"</b></font>

521
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:17,420
<font face="Museo Sans Rounded 700" size="44"><b>I think it's amazing</b></font>

522
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:21,880
<font face="Museo Sans Rounded 700" size="44"><b>That's why I chose Hatanaka-chan to be MVP</b></font>

523
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:24,570
<font face="Museo Sans Rounded 700" size="44"><b>Hatanaka is like this</b></font>

524
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:28,170
<font face="Museo Sans Rounded 700" size="44"><b>She can create things out of not understanding</b></font>

525
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:29,640
<font face="Museo Sans Rounded 700" size="44"><b>That's impressive.</b></font>

526
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:31,310
<font face="Museo Sans Rounded 700" size="44"><b>I'm often told that</b></font>

527
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,310
<font face="Museo Sans Rounded 700" size="44"><b>What do they say ?</b></font>

528
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:36,170
<font face="Museo Sans Rounded 700" size="44"><b>for example the fans say "Maybe something will come out someday."</b></font>

529
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,970
<font face="Museo Sans Rounded 700" size="44"><b>I said to him "Please look forward to it."</b></font>

530
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:43,310
<font face="Museo Sans Rounded 700" size="44"><b>That's what fans say.</b></font>

531
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:47,080
<font face="Museo Sans Rounded 700" size="44"><b>How gloomy.</b></font>

532
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:51,020
<font face="Museo Sans Rounded 700" size="44"><b>Good, that was good</b></font>
