00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:05,180
<font size="38">Nogizakatte, Doko?</font>

2
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:08,450
<font size="38">DON! 
-Ouch!</font>

3
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:10,760
<font size="38">Nogizakatte Doko has started, we're your hosts, Bananaman.</font>

4
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:12,160
<font size="38">I'm sorry.</font>

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,560
<font size="38">and here's... Nogizaka-chan~</font>

6
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:18,200
<font size="38">There are a lot of them.</font>

7
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:24,640
<font size="38">There are a lot of them here, what are we gonna do?</font>

8
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,610
<font size="38">You know it, don’t you?</font>

9
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:28,440
<font size="38">I don’t know, I don’t know anything. 
-We don’t have an idea.</font>

10
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:31,240
<font size="38">You knew about it beforehand, didn’t you? 
-What could it be?</font>

11
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,310
<font size="38">I don’t know…</font>

12
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:35,380
<font size="38">Now then, Himura-san, what do we have for today?</font>

13
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:40,620
<font size="38">Big annoucement of the senbatsu members for the 10th single!</font>

14
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:44,360
<font size="38">So fast, huh?</font>

15
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:49,230
<font size="38">We’re at the 10th single already, and again, this is kinda awesome,</font>

16
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:50,460
<font size="38">This is like a marker…</font>

17
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:52,330
<font size="38">A milestone, right? 
-That’s right.</font>

18
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:58,340
<font size="38">In this milestone, Ikuta who was in hiatus due to school work has returned..</font>

19
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:02,110
<font size="38">Until recently, my hair grew long and I looked mature.</font>

20
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:06,380
<font size="38">But for this recording, I cut again back to the way it was.</font>

21
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:08,080
<font size="38">To the way it was.</font>

22
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,450
<font size="38">Were you out for a long time?! 
-Yes.</font>

23
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:12,990
<font size="38">For your hair to grow that much…</font>

24
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:13,050
<font size="38">Yes, that’s how it goes.</font>

25
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:14,590
<font size="40"><b>Growth period?</b></font>

26
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:17,220
<font size="38">She’s young so her hair grows rapidly, right? 
-Really?</font>

27
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:19,790
<font size="38">But, from here on out, let’s work hard.</font>

28
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:21,060
<font size="38">yoroshiku onegaishimasu~</font>

29
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:24,330
<font size="38">And then, there's a new kenkyuusei</font>

30
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:25,200
<font size="38">Where is she?</font>

31
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,470
<font size="38">Who is it?</font>

32
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:28,170
<font size="38">Can you please introduce yourself?</font>

33
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:30,000
<font size="38">Raised in Saitama,</font>

34
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,640
<font size="38">in my 2nd year of high school, 16 years old, I’m Sagara Iori.</font>

35
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,870
<font size="38">yoroshiku onegaishimasu~</font>

36
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:36,980
<font size="38">Sagara-san?</font>

37
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:38,940
<font size="38">I am often called as Sagara-san by mistake.</font>

38
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:39,380
<font size="40"><b>Shitara is almost same as Sagara</b></font>

39
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:42,480
<font size="38">Not as Shitara, right? Since it is also read as Sagara.</font>

40
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:45,180
<font size="38">Sagara, it is “au” followed by “tanoshi” right?</font>

41
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,220
<font size="38">Ah, yes. Ah…</font>

42
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:49,390
<font size="38">Same as Sagara Haruko-san? 
-“ai” in aite followed by “tanoshi”</font>

43
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:51,360
<font size="38">“Ai,” right?</font>

44
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:53,730
<font size="38">Uhmm, I’m in a panic, what to do?</font>

45
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:53,860
<font size="40"><b>Isn’t getting through.</b></font>

46
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:56,730
<font size="38">It’s nothing to panic about.</font>

47
00:01:56,730 --> 00:02:01,030
<font size="38">”Au” followed by “tanoshi” right?</font>

48
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:02,740
<font size="38">That’s what I said. 
-You did?</font>

49
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:04,170
<font size="38">Oi! That’s what he said!</font>

50
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:04,800
<font size="40"><b>Baptism of Banana.</b></font>

51
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,670
<font size="38">We’re just kidding. 
-I’m sorry.</font>

52
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:12,680
<font size="38">Again, this time, Matsui Rena and Saito Yuuri are absent due to work.</font>

53
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:16,280
<font size="38">Well then, the 10th single senbatsu announcement,</font>

54
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,150
<font size="38">the formation is…</font>

55
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,720
<font size="38">Here is the formation for the 10th single.</font>

56
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:26,330
<font size="38">As you can see,</font>

57
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:28,130
<font size="38">1st row has five members,</font>

58
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:29,560
<font size="38">2nd row has five members as well,</font>

59
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,430
<font size="38">3rd row has six members.</font>

60
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:33,530
<font size="38">There’ll be 16 senbatsu members.</font>

61
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:41,140
<font size="38">And then, the 10 members from the 1st and 2nd row will be the 10-Fukujin.</font>

62
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,240
<font size="38">There were 17 members for the 9th single,</font>

63
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,980
<font size="38">so it is one person less this time.</font>

64
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:47,910
<font size="38">But the 10-Fukujin stays the same, right?</font>

65
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:50,550
<font size="38">5-5-6, right?</font>

66
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:53,250
<font size="38">Very well, shall we begin?</font>

67
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:54,420
<font size="38">yoroshiku onegaishimasu~</font>

68
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:55,190
<font size="38">Very well,</font>

69
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:56,150
<font size="38">3rd row,</font>

70
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:57,320
<font size="38">#11</font>

71
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:01,960
<font size="38">The first member who’ll enter the senbatsu is…</font>

72
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,100
<font size="38">Eto Misa</font>

73
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,530
<font size="38">hai, Eto, douzo~</font>

74
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:14,840
<font size="38">Eto who has her first consecutive selection in the senbatsu,</font>

75
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:18,310
<font size="38">we look forward to more of her activities as Nogizaka’s oneesan.</font>

76
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:21,650
<font size="38">I made it in the senbatsu for the 9th single,</font>

77
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:26,390
<font size="38">but for me personally, I have some regrets.</font>

78
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:26,890
<font size="38">Oh, really?</font>

79
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:30,090
<font size="38">I’ll go back to the basics once again.</font>

80
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:32,760
<font size="38">Regardless of being a senbatsu or an under,</font>

81
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,390
<font size="38">knowing what my dream is,</font>

82
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:38,260
<font size="38">thinking of the team more often,</font>

83
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:41,530
<font size="38">I’d like to do these properly.</font>

84
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:43,700
<font size="38">Because the chance was given to me this time,</font>

85
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:47,510
<font size="38">I’d like to do my best in this position.</font>

86
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:51,440
<font size="38">And I’d like to convey my gratitude to the fans.</font>

87
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,750
<font size="38">Thank you very much.</font>

88
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,450
<font size="38">Do your best, okay? 
-omedetou~ ganbatte~</font>

89
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:56,720
<font size="38">Proceed to the #11 spot.</font>

90
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:02,660
<font size="38">One member has been decided, there are 15 remaining.</font>

91
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:07,030
<font size="38">The next member who’ll enter the senbatsu is…</font>

92
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:09,360
<font size="38">Saito Chiharu</font>

93
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,230
<font size="38">Oh?</font>

94
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:17,700
<font size="38">hai, omedetou~</font>

95
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,740
<font size="38">She’ll have her most desired first senbatsu in the 10th single,</font>

96
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:26,350
<font size="38">Please show off that character loved by the members as much as you like.</font>

97
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:28,080
<font size="38">It took you a long time.</font>

98
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,720
<font size="38">It took me a long time.</font>

99
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:33,090
<font size="38">You made it in.</font>

100
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:35,320
<font size="38">Good for you.</font>

101
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:37,560
<font size="38">Good for you.</font>

102
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,290
<font size="38">What do you think about this?</font>

103
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:45,400
<font size="38">I've always been an Under,</font>

104
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,430
<font size="38">As I’ve thought, it’s like…</font>

105
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:56,610
<font size="38">More than anyone, I can’t get anything done and I was really frustrated of it.</font>

106
00:04:57,410 --> 00:05:00,950
<font size="38">So I knew I won’t be chosen.</font>

107
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:02,850
<font size="38">but…</font>

108
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:08,920
<font size="38">Thank goodness right? 
-It's alright, it's alright.</font>

109
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,790
<font size="38">But you know this day will come, right?</font>

110
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:12,760
<font size="38">You were working hard while thinking of it.</font>

111
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:20,770
<font size="38">I want to change for the better with this opportunity.</font>

112
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:24,970
<font size="38">I want to be a someone who is acknowledged by everyone.</font>

113
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:27,910
<font size="38">Then, do your best.</font>

114
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:30,380
<font size="38">Please proceed to that spot. 
-Please proceed.</font>

115
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:32,210
<font size="38">hai omedetou~</font>

116
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:35,650
<font size="38">Amazing, right? 
-Good for her.</font>

117
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:39,150
<font size="38">There are 14 spots remaining.</font>

118
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,350
<font size="38">3rd row</font>

119
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:43,560
<font size="38">the member who’ll enter in the #12 spot is…</font>

120
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:46,330
<font size="38">Wakatsuki Yumi</font>

121
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:50,630
<font size="38">hai, douzo~</font>

122
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:56,570
<font size="38">Wakatsuki who always give her 100% in Nogizaka,</font>

123
00:05:56,570 --> 00:06:00,210
<font size="38">that handsome guy personality of hers is essential to the group.</font>

124
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,210
<font size="38">Okay, Wakatsuki.</font>

125
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:08,380
<font size="38">It’s okay.</font>

126
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,860
<font size="38">I’m sorry. 
-No problem.</font>

127
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:27,370
<font size="38">Recently, there have been a lot of things that I’m worried about.</font>

128
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:28,570
<font size="38">Oh really?</font>

129
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:29,640
<font size="38">Why is that?</font>

130
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:37,380
<font size="38">Well, you see… I’ve been wondering if I’m making any progress.</font>

131
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,880
<font size="38">Really?</font>

132
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:43,820
<font size="38">And then, this time, my position dropped.</font>

133
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:48,390
<font size="38">What should I say?</font>

134
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:50,120
<font size="38">Were my efforts not enough?</font>

135
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:54,090
<font size="38">That’s why your emotions are mixed up.</font>

136
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,100
<font size="38">I think you’re thinking too much.</font>

137
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:02,840
<font size="38">Although, I think everyone has their own worries.</font>

138
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:05,270
<font size="38">I’m not the only one who has worries,</font>

139
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:08,210
<font size="38">I’m not the only one who is giving it their best.</font>

140
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:12,510
<font size="38">Everyone is working hard, I have to catch up with them.</font>

141
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:14,510
<font size="38">This time, I’m reminded of that.</font>

142
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:15,880
<font size="38">I'll do my best.</font>

143
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:16,850
<font size="38">Do your best, okay?</font>

144
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:18,850
<font size="38">I can’t say anything but do your best.</font>

145
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:20,690
<font size="38">Everything will be alright. 
-Do your best!</font>

146
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,150
<font size="38">Thank you very much.</font>

147

156
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:58,120
<font size="38">Saito Chiharu’s spot is Takayama’s usual spot, right?</font>

157
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:01,460
<font size="38">I thought I won’t make it...</font>

158
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:06,600

181
00:08:57,650 --> 00:09:02,020
<font size="38">It can’t be helped, so even if they differ from each other, 
it’s better to let it out, don’t hide it.</font>

<font size="38">Did the staffs tell you something?</font>

220
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:42,890
<font size="38">”Smile = to become Minami”</font>

221
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:45,690
<font size="38">I was told to smile, and then,</font>

222
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:47,090
<font size="38">I said okay.</font>

223
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:52,130
<font size="38">Certainly, you have this smiling image a lot recently. 
-I think so too.</font>

224
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,570
<font size="38">That’s true, I think it’s better if you smile.</font>

225
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,470
<font size="38">Therefore,</font>

226
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:59,710

236
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:27,700
<font size="38">From this point, it’ll be the 10-Fukujin. 
-That’s right.</font>

00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:32,140
<font size="38">The first member who’ll enter the 10-Fukujin is…</font>

241
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:48,190
<font size="38">With her generosity, we expect her watch over the members and be in the position to lead them at the same time.</font>

00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:52,020
<font size="38">This 10th single is referred as a milestone,</font>

243
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:57,400

258
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:39,940
<font size="38">this time, will we see another side of her?</font>

259
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:44,610
<font size="38">I don’t know what kind of song this is gonna be...</font>

260
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:48,550
<font size="38">Since Takayama-san doesn’t say “positive” that much anymore,</font>

261
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:53,950
<font size="38">What if I will copy that positive chara here in the 10th single?</font>

262
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:54,790
<font size="38">I see. 
-That would be nice.</font>

269
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:09,300
<font size="38">Let’s give it a go. Ready, set~</font>

273
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:22,610
<font size="38">That was probably the maximum “positive” that Takayama can do right now.</font>

274
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:23,880
<font size="40"><b>Limit for positive.</b></font>

275
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,550

-Everyone, positive!</font>

276
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:28,890
<font size="38">It’s like a normal fighting pose.</font>

277
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:30,960
<font size="38">Saying “positive positive!” to everyone,</font>

278
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:33,890

<font size="38">with her leadership skills, will she be able to overcome the tasks at hand?</font>

293
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:12,930
<font size="38">The next one will be the 10th single, so…</font>

294
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:15,430
<font size="38">it will be an important milestone.</font>

295
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:25,140
<font size="38">So that Nogizaka can accelerate further and move in a good direction,</font>

296
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:32,180
<font size="38">In this single, I’d like to do my best once again.</font>

297
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:37,060
<font size="38">At the end, we’ll be hearing from you again, so…</font>

298
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:39,460
<font size="38">Oh no! I’ve said it all already!</font>

299
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:41,390
<font size="38">Say something different.</font>

300
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,430
<font size="40"><b>We’ll have another take!</b></font>

301
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:45,630
<font size="38">omedetou gozaimasu~</font>

302
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:50,270
<font size="38">Two spots left in the 2nd row, #7 and #8.</font>

303
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:54,740
<font size="38">Next, 2nd row, the member who’ll get in the #7 spot is…</font>

304
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:57,680
<font size="38">Akimoto Manatsu</font>

305
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:00,250
<font size="38">hai, Akimoto~</font>

306
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:05,050
<font size="38">Following the last time, she made it in the 10-Fukujin.</font>

307
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:06,550
<font size="38">She has also developed a black hearted character,</font>

308
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:10,090
<font size="38">it seems like the teasing from the members will increase this time?!</font>

309
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:13,330
<font size="38">Nogizaka’s 10th single.</font>

310
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:16,760
<font size="38">We were allowed to do different kinds of things,</font>

311
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:19,000
<font size="38">and because we have grown...</font>

312
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:24,370
<font size="38">we have to brace ourselves and unite again.</font>

313
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:27,070
<font size="38">That’s right, you must be united as a group.</font>

314
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:31,740
<font size="38">Because I really love Nogizaka,</font>

315
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:36,680
<font size="38">I want to grow more and work harder so that I could be someone who can lead others.</font>

316
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:37,680
<font size="38">That’s nice.</font>

317
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,750
<font size="38">Do your best, okay?</font>

318
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:39,850
<font size="38">Thank you very much.</font>

319
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:41,150
<font size="38">omedetou~ 
- #7 spot, right?</font>

320
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:45,960
<font size="38">One spot left in the 2nd row. 
-Ah, you’re right.</font>

321
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:50,730
<font size="38">The last  member who’ll make it in the 2nd row is…</font>

322
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:53,260
<font size="38">Ikoma Rina</font>

323
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:56,000
<font size="38">hai, douzo, Ikoma~</font>

324
00:15:56,770 --> 00:16:01,510
<font size="38">Ikoma became active as senbatsu member for both Nogizaka and AKB,</font>

325
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:04,010
<font size="38">What lies along that path?</font>

326
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:09,610
<font size="38">I’m happy to have a lot of work and opportunities.</font>

327
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,280
<font size="38">To be honest,</font>

328
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:21,490
<font size="38">I also have worries that I won’t be able to finish the things that I have to get done.</font>

329
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:25,600
<font size="38">There are a lot of things you have to memorize right? Twice than what you have?</font>

330
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,500
<font size="38">Or maybe more than that? You have to memorize everything from the start.</font>

331
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:34,540
<font size="38">You have to work hard to squeeze it in and remember it all.</font>

332
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:37,240
<font size="38">But this is the path that you chose.</font>

333
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,980
<font size="38">I think you are growing bigger and bigger.</font>

334
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:42,180
<font size="38">Do your best, so that you can lead again.</font>

335
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:44,920
<font size="38">Please don’t give up! 
-Please!</font>

336
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:46,380
<font size="38">I'll do my best!</font>

337
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,550
<font size="38">Then, proceed to your spot.</font>

338
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:52,820
<font size="38">Only five remaining, who will be chosen as the center?</font>

339
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:55,760
<font size="38">We’re at the 1st row.</font>

340
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:57,930
<font size="38">Let's move on, onegaishimasu~</font>

341
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,200
<font size="38">1st row,</font>

342
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,500
<font size="38">#5</font>

343
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,670
<font size="38">The first front member is…</font>

344
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,640
<font size="38">Hashimoto Nanami</font>

345
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:09,570
<font size="38">hai, Hashimoto~</font>

346
00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:15,110
<font size="38">She's always composed, Nogizaka’s cool beauty, Hashimoto,</font>

347
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:18,750
<font size="38">She has acquired the Nanamin-beam recently, along with a new side of her.</font>

348
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:22,420
<font size="38">To be honest, I thought I’ll be replaced.</font>

349
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:25,320
<font size="38">I thought I’ll be in the 2nd row…</font>

350
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:29,530
<font size="38">I was wondering if I’ll be called right there.</font>

351
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:31,400
<font size="38">Why do you think you’ll be replaced?</font>

352
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,870
<font size="38">How do I put this? It’s like…</font>

353
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:40,670
<font size="38">I have felt that I am stagnant.</font>

354
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:43,840
<font size="38">I have brought it on myself…</font>

355
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:47,680
<font size="38">Hashimoto is like that, you often think low of yourself.</font>

356
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:50,780
<font size="38">I think that you’re making progress.</font>

357
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:54,520
<font size="38">This group is already growing rapidly at such tremendous speed.</font>

358
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,950
<font size="38">When you’re in that group...</font>

359
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:59,290
<font size="38">you may not see your surroundings well at times.</font>

360
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:02,860
<font size="38">You can't see it because there are times where you think too much.</font>

361
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:04,600
<font size="38">That’s what I think.</font>

362
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:06,600
<font size="38">I think so too. 
-Yes.</font>

363
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:12,200
<font size="38">It would be nice if this could be a chance for me to become positive.</font>

364
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:15,010
<font size="38">Do your best, since you’re someone who leads the group.</font>

365
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:15,770
<font size="38">onegaishimasu~</font>

366
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,480
<font size="38">hai, omedetou~</font>

367
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:22,380
<font size="38">Four spots remaining.</font>

368
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:24,250
<font size="38">Yes, four spots.</font>

369
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:28,190
<font size="38">1st row, who’ll get into the #1 spot?</font>

370
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:30,720
<font size="38">Matsui Rena</font>

371
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,590
<font size="38">Matsui, right?</font>

372
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,330
<font size="38">She’s not here, though.</font>

373
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:37,960
<font size="38">She likes talking about her favorite bread and anime,</font>

374
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:40,230
<font size="38">Matsui gradually began to show her color.</font>

375
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,630
<font size="38">We’ll take more notice of her from now on!</font>

376
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:48,510
<font size="38">Now then, just three spots left.</font>

377
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:51,110
<font size="38">Next, 1st row,</font>

378
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:53,180
<font size="38">The member who will be called for the #4 spot is...</font>

379
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,910
<font size="38">Nishino Nanase</font>

380
00:18:56,110 --> 00:19:00,790
<font size="38">hai, Nishino~</font>

381
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:04,690
<font size="38">Nishino who served as the center for two consecutive singles is growing rapidly.</font>

382
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:08,130
<font size="38">We expect her to take on the role of leading the members in this single.</font>

383
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:14,930
<font size="38">I was allowed to be the center twice.</font>

384
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:16,730
<font size="38">What was it?</font>

385
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:21,310
<font size="38">I remember the challenges.</font>

386
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:25,610
<font size="38">No matter what it was, I never ran away.</font>

387
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:30,850
<font size="38">It’s like… I am able to change just so that I could challenge those things.</font>

388
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:36,450
<font size="38">Because it gave me a really valuable experience,</font>

389
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:42,590
<font size="38">I’d like to do my best in the 10th single so that I can grow more.</font>

390
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:44,900
<font size="38">She has already grown, right?</font>

391
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:51,040
<font size="38">It’s because, I was thinking of the past, you can even announce your feelings publicly like that.</font>

392
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,870
<font size="38">What was it?</font>

393
00:19:54,170 --> 00:20:00,650
<font size="38">I don’t really like how I look…</font>

394
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:02,480
<font size="38">I’m not cute at all.</font>

395
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,450
<font size="38">That’s not true.</font>

396
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:04,750
<font size="38">Everyone was like “ehh?”</font>

397
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:07,350
<font size="38">Himura-san has to kill himself if that’s the case. 
-That’s true.</font>

398
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:10,990
<font size="38">I have never thought, not even once, that Himura-san’s face is disgusting. </font>

399
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:11,420
<font size="38">Nobody has mentioned anything about it!</font>

400
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:13,090
<font size="40"><b>Don’t go that far.</b></font>

401
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:14,790
<font size="38">We didn’t mention anything about his face being disgusting!</font>

402
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:16,530
<font size="38">You can’t go that far!</font>

403
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:21,900
<font size="38">After this, the center will finally be decided!</font>

404
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:25,300
<font size="38">Who will be the remaining two?</font>

405
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:27,210
<font size="38">We’ll start with the announcement of #2, right?</font>

406
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,940
<font size="38">Last two, the first one who’ll get called is…</font>

407
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,280
<font size="38">Shiraishi Mai</font>

408
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:42,020
<font size="38">She’s always standing at the front, Shiraishi is pulling the group.</font>

409
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:46,020
<font size="38">We expect Kuroishi-san’s activation in the future.</font>

410
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,790
<font size="38">This will be the 10th single.</font>

411
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:54,630
<font size="38">Nogizaka is also in its third year.</font>

412
00:20:57,170 --> 00:21:01,310
<font size="38">I can really feel that this is an important period.</font>

413
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:04,140
<font size="38">That’s my impression of it personally.</font>

414
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:10,320
<font size="38">I think it would be nice if our scope can expand.</font>

415
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:13,790
<font size="38">I thought Shiraishi will be called as the center,</font>

416
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:15,220
<font size="38">for this 10th single.</font>

417
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:16,790
<font size="38">No, no.</font>

418
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:20,190
<font size="38">I’m the same with Hashimoto, I thought I’ll be replaced.</font>

419
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:20,960
<font size="38">Really?</font>

420
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:25,460
<font size="38">We never had the impression that you felt that way.</font>

421
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:29,200
<font size="38">That’s why I thought, “She’ll be called right here!”</font>

422
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:30,400
<font size="38">Please do your best.</font>

423
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,440
<font size="38">Yes. Thank you very much. 
-omedetou gozaimasu~</font>

424
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:38,140
<font size="38">All that’s left is the center.</font>

425
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:40,440
<font size="38">Whoever it is, this is gonna be her first?</font>

426
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:43,750
<font size="38">Someone who has no center experience until now.</font>

427
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:48,920
<font size="38">Nogizaka46, the 10th single which is worthy of being commemorated,</font>

428
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,090
<font size="38">the center is...</font>

429
00:21:56,860 --> 00:22:00,330
<font size="38">Ikuta Erika</font>

430
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:01,470
<font size="38">hai, Ikuta~</font>

431
00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:09,370
<font size="38">Ikuta is selected for her first center immediately after her hiatus.</font>

432
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:14,010
<font size="38">With that innocence, will she be able to build a new image for the center?</font>

433
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,610
<font size="38">We’ve arrived at the 10th single.</font>

434
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:17,880
<font size="38">Wait, are you okay?</font>

435
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,780
<font size="38">Right now, you’re kinda…</font>

436
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:23,390
<font size="38">Her face is… she’s completely stunned.</font>

437
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:25,790
<font size="38">Ikuta, you were called.</font>

438
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:31,060
<font size="38">I never predicted this would happen.</font>

439
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,400
<font size="38">You’re the center.</font>

440
00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:42,470
<font size="38">I was away for a while,</font>

441
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:46,810
<font size="38">furthermore, I can’t really feel it.</font>

442
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:58,160
<font size="38">I got that kind of feeling but, you were called as the center.</font>

443
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:02,460
<font size="38">Ikuta-san will be singing as the center for the 10th single.</font>

444
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:05,660
<font size="38">No, no.</font>

445
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:07,770
<font size="38">She even tilted her head like that.</font>

446
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:08,730
<font size="38">That’s true, but stil…</font>

447
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:13,340
<font size="38">It’s like… I just came back, then suddenly, I’m the center…</font>

448
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:16,940
<font size="38">Personally, I have mixed feelings about it,</font>

449
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:21,650
<font size="38">I'm pretty sure that it is impudent of me to be here.</font>

450
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:23,250
<font size="38">Hmmm, it’s like…</font>

451
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,050
<font size="38">Hhmm, but...</font>

452
00:23:27,050 --> 00:23:35,730
<font size="38">My own power… it would be nice if I could show a lot of it.</font>

453
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:38,500
<font size="38">But… 
-There’s nothing you can do but to do your best, right?</font>

454
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,130
<font size="38">Do your best.</font>

455
00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:40,330
<font size="38">You’re going to do it anyway, so you’ll do it, right?</font>

456
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:42,230
<font size="38">-Let’s do this! Do your best!</font>

457
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:43,600
<font size="38">I will!</font>

458
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,600
<font size="38">Please go to the center spot.</font>

459
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,640
<font size="38">yoroshiku onegaishimasu~</font>

460
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:50,640
<font size="38">Please go ahead.</font>

461
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:58,550
<font size="38">There we have it, worthy of being commemorated, 
the senbatsu members for Nogizaka46’s 10th single are decided.</font>

462
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:02,920
<font size="38">Finally, here’s the comment from Matsui who made it in the senbatsu.</font>

463
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:10,760
<font size="38">I’m really happy to be able to participate in the single as Nogizaka’s senbatsu once again.</font>

464
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:14,730
<font size="38">Since Iku-chan was taking a break during the last single,</font>

465
00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:18,700
<font size="38">This will be the first time I’ll be able to work with her along with the senbatsu members.</font>

466
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:23,440
<font size="38">I’m really looking forward to working with Nogizaka.</font>

467
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:29,510
<font size="38">For the 10th single, with the feeling of putting everything on the line,</font>

468
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:33,780
<font size="38">I want to make a great single with everyone.</font>

469
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:39,820
<font size="38">For the fans, please look forward to its completion. We’d be glad if you will wait for it.</font>

470
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:41,820
<font size="38"></font>
