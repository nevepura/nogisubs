00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:05,280
<font size="40">4th single campaign! Hit prayer in places that bring good fortune!</font>

2
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:08,320
<font size="40">What they’re attempting to do is dangerous!</font>

3
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:13,530
<font size="40">From all corners of the country, risking their lives, they’ll attempt rigorous ascetic exercises!</font>

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,130
<font size="40">Considered as the harshest location shoot in Nogidoko’s history,</font>

5
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:22,630
<font size="40">What kind of fate awaits for the members?!</font>

6
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:27,410
<font size="40">Nogizakatte, Doko?</font>

7
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:49,390
<font size="40">Nogizaka46's 4th single, Seifuku no Mannequin is on sale!</font>

8
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:51,500
<font size="40">which means...</font>

9
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,070
<font size="40">So, every time a new single goes on sale, in order for it to sell…</font>

10
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,670
<font size="40">Campaign.</font>

11
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:00,370
<font size="40">And this time, we’ll do it too.</font>

12
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:01,740
<font size="40">Himura-san, 
-Yes?</font>

13
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:04,310
<font size="40">Just like a Mannequin, please announce what we have for today.</font>

14
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:14,880
<font size="40">Let’s do the hit prayer in places that bring good fortune!</font>

15
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:21,890
<font size="40">For this campaign, the members are split into four teams,</font>

16
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:30,230
<font size="40">They’ll go to various highly regarded places that bring good fortune to do the hit prayer for Seifuku no Mannequin.</font>

17
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:34,340
<font size="40">This is by far the harshest of them all.</font>

18
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,580
<font size="40">I think it’s not on that level where it’ll just make you cry.</font>

19
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:41,240
<font size="40">I think there’ll be a casualty.</font>

20
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,480
<font size="40"><b>Serious matter.</b></font>

21
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,080
<font size="40">No one will die!</font>

22
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:49,420
<font size="40">And the places where they'll do the hit campaign are?</font>

23
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,820
<font size="40">Here it is!</font>

24
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:53,020
<font size="40">JAN!</font>

25
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:57,830
<font size="40">What is this all about?</font>

26
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:58,560
<font size="40">The members will do a hit prayer on places related to these four categories.</font>

27
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:58,560
<font size="40">Mountain</font>

28
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:58,560
<font size="40">Fire</font>

29
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:58,560
<font size="40">Cliff</font>

30
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:04,400
<font size="40">Water</font>

31
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:09,800
<font size="40">The place where each team will go is decided by Himura via draw lots.</font>

32
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:15,010
<font size="40">First up, Ikoma-Nishino-Fukagawa-Wakatsuki Team.</font>

33
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:21,750
<font size="40">Cliff!</font>

34
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:27,150
<font size="40">Next, Shiraishi-Matsumura-Inoue-Saito Asuka Team.</font>

35
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,020
<font size="40">Mountain!</font>

36
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:38,700
<font size="40">And then, Sakurai-Hashimoto-Hoshino-Takayama Team.</font>

37
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:40,930
<font size="40">Fire!</font>

38
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:48,010
<font size="40">All that’s left for Ikuta-Akimoto-Ichiki-Noujo Team is…</font>

39
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:51,240
<font size="40">Jyan! Water.</font>

40
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,720
<font size="40">This time, as for the objective, every member has to complete the hit prayer.</font>

41
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,520
<font size="40">I see.</font>

42
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,360
<font size="40">Not just one, they all must complete it.</font>

43
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,390
<font size="40">They must complete it until the end.</font>

44
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:05,020
<font size="40">That is their objective.</font>

45
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:09,930
<font size="40">The four teams will split up, departing to the prayer location.</font>

46
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:13,630
<font size="40">DON!</font>

47
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:14,370
<font size="26">Tottori Prefecture, Touhaku District, Misasa Town.</font>

48
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:15,870
<font size="40">DON!</font>

49
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:17,840
<font size="40">We’re Team Mountain, and for that,</font>

50
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,010
<font size="40">we’ve arrived safely here in Tottori prefecture!</font>

51
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,640
<font size="40">Yes, we’ve come to Tottori.</font>

52
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:29,210
<font size="40">The place related to “Mountain” where this team is going to is…</font>

53
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:30,980
<font size="40">Ready, set...</font>

54
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:33,450
<font size="40"></font>

55
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:37,050
<font size="40">Eh? That one?</font>

56
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:37,460
<font size="20">You're going there?</font>

57
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:39,460
<font size="40"><b>Here?</b></font>

58
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:44,400
<font size="40">You are all going there to do the hit prayer.</font>

59
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,800
<font size="40"></font>

60
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:50,740
<font size="40">Here is Mt. Mitoku, Sanbutsu-ji, Nageire-do.</font>

61
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:54,540
<font size="40">Standing on the top of a cliff, this temple has 1300 years of history.</font>

62
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:58,480
<font size="40">In the past, military commanders would go and pray here before the battle,</font>

63
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:02,780
<font size="40">Having their prayers for luck at winning fulfilled, 
it is said that this place truly brings good fortune.</font>

64
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:03,650
<font size="20"></font>

65
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:10,250
<font size="40">However, to get there, they must go through a trackless path and a steep cliff.</font>

66
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:12,590
<font size="40">There are a lot of visitors coming here,</font>

67
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:15,990
<font size="40">and in the past, there were incidents of death due to slipping down.</font>

68
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:19,060
<font size="40">Regulation which prohibits visitors to climb up alone was adopted.</font>

69
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:23,830
<font size="40">It is called as the Japan’s most dangerous National treasure shrine.</font>

70
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,170
<font size="40">They immediately changed into monastic attire and prayed for safety in their journey.</font>

71
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:31,010
<font size="20">You're all properly 
suited up for this.</font>

72
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:33,880
<font size="40">Under the guidance of Sanbutsu-ji’s deputy chief priest,</font>

73
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:38,080
<font size="40">for the sake of the big hit prayer, they’re headed to Japan’s most dangerous national treasure!</font>

74
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:42,290
<font size="40">Woah, this is quite something.</font>

75
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:46,620
<font size="20">Everyone has this same outfit?</font>

76
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:48,490
<font size="40"></font>

77
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:53,660
<font size="40">Befitting of the nickname Japan’s most dangerous national treasure,</font>

78
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:56,700
<font size="40">Immediately after entering the mountain area,
 climbing up with both hands...</font>

79
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,770
<font size="40">the steep mountain path continues.</font>

80
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,940
<font size="40">And then…</font>

81
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:07,080
<font size="40">This place is called Kazura-zaka.</font>

82
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:10,710
<font size="40">If you make one misstep, you will fall to the bottom of the ravine, leaving serious injuries.</font>

83
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:14,320
<font size="40">The first obstacle, Kazura-zaka</font>

84
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:18,220
<font size="40">They must grab and climb the roots of a tree protruding from a vertical cliff,</font>

85
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:21,190
<font size="40">If an accident happened, serious injuries are inevitable.</font>

86
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:24,060
<font size="40">The danger level is: 7.</font>

87
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,390
<font size="20">This is dangerous, indeed.</font>

88
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:28,360
<font size="40">Maiyan! Ganbare~</font>

89
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,770
<font size="20"></font>

90
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:43,510
<font size="40">The roots of the tree they’re climbing is along a steep cliff.</font>

91
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:47,110
<font size="20"></font>

92
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:50,080
<font size="40">There are a lot of spots to step on,</font>

93
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,820
<font size="40">You better grab on the roots tightly.</font>

94
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:57,790
<font size="40">If they lost their footing, it will be a 10 meter drop.</font>

95
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:01,400
<font size="40">Without assurance about their lives and with a great danger, they move along the mountain trail.</font>

96
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,760
<font size="40">I’m scared, I’m scared, I’m scared. Wait up, wait up, wait up.</font>

97
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,200
<font size="20"></font>

98
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:07,800
<font size="40">I think it’s better if you hold on to that root on the uppermost part.</font>

99
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:28,020
<font size="40">Even though they overcame a dangerous spot, 
one dangerous slope after another awaits for the members.</font>

100
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:31,390
<font size="40">Do your best! For the sake of being a hit, do your best.</font>

101
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:35,260
<font size="40">Hang in there! For the hit prayer.</font>

102
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:38,430
<font size="40">It’s alright, please believe in yourself and come up.</font>

103
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,240
<font size="40">An hour and a half passed since they entered the mountain area.</font>

104
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,470
<font size="20">The paths were always like this? 
All throughout?</font>

105
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:51,880
<font size="40">The members keep on climbing the dangerous trackless path.</font>

106
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:57,380
<font size="40">From the extreme nervousness of having their lives in danger,</font>

107
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:59,750
<font size="40">Their tired looks has begun to show.</font>

108
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:02,720
<font size="40">However, there are new difficulties!</font>

109
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,090
<font size="40">Please wait!</font>

110
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,030
<font size="40">This is not good.</font>

111
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:15,100
<font size="40">This is the bottom of the ravine, right?</font>

112
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:19,370
<font size="40">The second obstacle, Kusari-zaka</font>

113
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:23,210
<font size="40">They have to cling onto the exposed rocks to climb up,</font>

114
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:27,650
<font size="40">and while holding on to the chain, they will climb the cliff just like rock climbing.</font>

115
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:32,180
<font size="40">An accident here would be life-threatening, so the danger level here is at the max of 10.</font>

116
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:34,450
<font size="40">Once your feet slipped, you’ll be at the bottom.</font>

117
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:35,750
<font size="40"><b>Fear of death.</b></font>

118
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,290
<font size="40">So be careful.</font>

119
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,760
<font size="40">We have to hold on tight.</font>

120
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:41,660
<font size="40">ganbare~ Maiyan~</font>

121
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,430
<font size="40"><b>Despair.</b></font>

122
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:51,740
<font size="40">Clinging on a vertical rock is what it’s like,</font>

123
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:54,240
<font size="40">Using both hands and feet to support their own body weight,</font>

124
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,340
<font size="40">but aiming for the top.</font>

125
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,840
<font size="40">I’m stumped.</font>

126
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:00,340
<font size="40">Eh? Wait! What am I gonna do?</font>

127
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:08,180
<font size="40">While being frightened by the fear of death accompanying them, 
the members take on this max-level dangerous path.</font>

128
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:12,560
<font size="40">Aa, I have arrived!</font>

129
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:14,520
<font size="40">Thank goodness!</font>

130
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:18,230
<font size="40">Shiraishi cleared the cliff with a length of approximately 15 meters.</font>

131
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:25,100
<font size="40">Then, Matsumura, followed by Inoue, they have scaled this cliff!</font>

132
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,000
<font size="40">Ashu, do your best! Just a little more!</font>

133
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,640
<font size="40">How will I go forward~?</font>

134
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:35,110
<font size="40">Left behind in the middle of the cliff is Saito Asuka.</font>

135
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:36,450
<font size="40">Going this way?</font>

136
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:37,710
<font size="20">Because you’re 
too small, right?</font>

137
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:39,850
<font size="20">This is your first climb, right?</font>

138
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:41,950
<font size="40">Eh? I'll die, I'll die, I'll die...</font>

139
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,050
<font size="40">I’m gonna die.</font>

140
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,260
<font size="40">Really, I will die!</font>

141
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,590
<font size="40">Saito Asuka looked at the bottom of the cliff and came into a panic about death.</font>

142
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:56,360
<font size="40">The deputy chief priest is on the rescue.</font>

143
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,700
<font size="40">And then…</font>

144
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:01,140
<font size="40">You did great! Thank goodness.</font>

145
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,770
<font size="40"><b>Tears.</b></font>

146
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:05,170
<font size="40">That was the most terrifying experience I’ve had. 
-It is scary, right?</font>

147

150
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:18,250
<font size="40">Now, everyone will climb this rock.</font>

151
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:18,850

overcame her fear of the steep trail.</font>

<font size="40">And then, about two-thirds of the whole journey, there's a hall. 
Here in the Monju-do, the priest performed a sutra chant.</font>

-There are cliffs there, right?</font>

00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:20,420
<font size="40"><b>Fainting in agony.</b></font>

291
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:23,620
<font size="40"></font>

292
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:28,630
<font size="40">And then, in rapid succession…</font>

293
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:40,740
<font size="40">A shriek of intense pain came out after the blow coming from above,</font>

294
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:42,840
<font size="40">However, coming from the chief priest…</font>

295
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:44,980
<font size="40">Isn’t that a little lenient?</font>

296
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:47,040
<font size="40"><b>Finding flaws.</b></font>

297
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,710
<font size="40">It's not something to be frantic about.</font>

298
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:49,810
<font size="40">It really hurts.</font>

299
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:56,090
<font size="40">Well then, I’ll do it seriously just a little.</font>

300
00:17:56,090 --> 00:18:00,420
<font size="40"><b>Upgrade.</b></font>

301
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:02,430
<font size="40"><b>Bombardment.</b></font>

302
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:03,790
<font size="20">That one's completely different.</font>

303
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:07,800
<font size="40">And then, Hashimoto also received the same damage.</font>

304
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:15,300
<font size="40">Okay, it have served its purpose.</font>

305
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,850
<font size="40">Even after preparing their spirit with Zazen meditation,</font>

306
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:27,920
<font size="40">In order to perform the Hiwatari Shinji, the members will continue even further in their training.</font>

307
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:33,090
<font size="40">Right here, in order to form a connection with Fukoji’s primary deity, Bishamonten,</font>

308
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:33,090
<font size="40">they must undergo a ceremony called Kechien-kanjou</font>

309
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:36,190
<font size="36" color="#000000"><b><i>{\an8}Kechien-kanjou – a ritual to form a connection with deities.</i></b></font>

310
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:45,170
<font size="40">A person can’t participate on the Hiwatari Shinji as a devotee if they didn’t go through this ritual.</font>

311
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:48,670
<font size="40">Now then, for the sake of the hit prayer!</font>

312
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:50,170
<font size="40">However…</font>

313
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:54,640
<font size="40"><b>Battling with drowsiness.</b></font>

314
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,040
<font size="20">That expression is awful, 
Takayama!</font>

315
00:18:57,410 --> 00:19:00,010
<font size="20"></font>

316
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:06,820
<font size="40">Right after this, they will challenge the scorching hot Hiwatari Shinji!</font>

317
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:15,430
<font size="40">The Kechien-kanjou ended smoothly, so they can now participate in public as devotees.</font>

318
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:21,130
<font size="40">The four members carried the wooden stick with their hit prayer written on them, which will be burned at the Hiwatari Shinji.</font>

319
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:26,870
<font size="40">Finally, it’s time to challenge the Hiwatari Shinji! However, there is a shocking scene!</font>

320
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:39,520
<font size="40">Shortly after kindling the fire, the smoke rises vigorously,</font>

321
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,190
<font size="40">Spreading terror to the ritual.</font>

322
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:45,590
<font size="40"><b>Apocalypse?</b></font>

323
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:49,560
<font size="40">While the fire slowly rises,</font>

324
00:19:49,560 --> 00:20:09,150
<font size="40">they will throw their wooden sticks with the hit prayer written on it into the fire. However…</font>

325
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:11,550
<font size="40">I hurled it so hard it went to the other side!</font>

326
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:14,150
<font size="40">It didn’t go into the fire at all. What do I do~?</font>

327
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,490
<font size="40">What?! Who would have ever thought that this will happen?!</font>

328
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,460
<font size="40">The precious wooden stick that Takayama threw never get into the fire.</font>

329
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:22,190
<font size="40">Wooden stick out of bounds.</font>

330
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:23,190
<font size="40">-Now It won’t be a hit anymore.</font>

331
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:26,200
<font size="40">And then Takayama’s wish is left as it is.</font>

332
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:29,200
<font size="40">Hiwatari Shinji will now start!</font>

333
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:35,410
<font size="40">Is it hot?</font>

334
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:37,010
<font size="40">It’s quite hot!</font>

335
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:39,340
<font size="40">It’s so hot today!</font>

336
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:44,680
<font size="40">The chief priest said that this year is likely to be the hottest of all time.</font>

337
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:46,480
<font size="40">She even said “Seriously, be careful.”</font>

338
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:52,020
<font size="40">In this record high temperature, the other devotees also have agony written all over their face.</font>

339
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:56,930
<font size="40">A detestable path, Hitawari Shinji, the danger level is: 10.</font>

340
00:20:58,530 --> 00:21:00,530
<font size="40">We'll start with Hashimoto.</font>

341
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:12,340
<font size="40">Praying for the 4th single to become a hit! It’s hot!</font>

342
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:14,810
<font size="40">Was it hot?</font>

343
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:23,320
<font size="40">Since I got to say the hit prayer, I think it’s okay!</font>

344
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:29,590
<font size="40">Hashimoto, not letting up to the heat, impressively walked on fire while saying the hit prayer.</font>

345
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:32,090
<font size="40">Next, Sakurai.</font>

346
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:33,900
<font size="40">Motivate yourself!</font>

347
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:36,130
<font size="40">Praying for a hit!</font>

348
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:42,340
<font size="40">It’s hot!</font>

349
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:47,510
<font size="40">Sakurai shouted for a hit prayer, but,</font>

350
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:51,110
<font size="40">unable to bear the heat, she dashed all the way to clear it.</font>

351
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:58,290
<font size="40">Next, Hoshino.</font>

352
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:00,260
<font size="40">What to do?!</font>

353
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,090
<font size="40">It will hurt if you jumped up and down, you just have to walk properly.</font>

354
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:08,160
<font size="40"><b>Jumping prohibited.</b></font>

355
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:12,070
<font size="20">She’s dashing!</font>

356
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:13,800
<font size="20">She’s dashing!</font>

357
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:23,180
<font size="40">Hoshino forgot the advice about jumping up and down, 
on top of that, she forgot about the hit prayer.</font>

358
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:25,580
<font size="40">But somehow, she succeed in the task.</font>

359
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:28,350
<font size="40">Last is Takayama,</font>

360
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:30,780
<font size="40">Will she be able to walk properly and do the hit prayer?</font>

361
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:42,530
<font size="40">It’s hot!</font>

362
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:54,610
<font size="40">Takayama endured the heat while walking desperately,</font>

363
00:22:54,610 --> 00:22:58,910
<font size="40">although the way she walked was disgusting, she impressively cleared the hit prayer!</font>

364
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:05,620
<font size="40">This part right here was really hot.</font>

365
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:09,290
<font size="40">Minami’s legs are trembling like “gakugaku”!</font>

366
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:16,660
<font size="40">And with that, the hit prayer of walking on fire, 
Everyone finished it successfully!</font>

367
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,940
<font size="40">Fire team, you walked on fire.</font>

368
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,590
<font size="40">Actually, when you take a quick glance at it,</font>

369
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:28,640
<font size="40">It seems that the fire died out, so it looks like it’s not hot at all!</font>

370
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,280
<font size="40">Hashimoto you were really composed.</font>

371
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,710
<font size="40">It was really hot.</font>

372
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:33,750
<font size="40">You were walking normally, Hashimoto.</font>

373
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:35,750
<font size="40">I thought that it was dangerous, but then,</font>

374
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:36,480
<font size="40">everyone were doing like this after that.</font>

375
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,020
<font size="40"><b>Overreaction?</b></font>

376
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:40,620
<font size="40">It’s because Hashimoto has a really weak reaction.</font>

377
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:43,350
<font size="40">Isn't Hashimoto’s reaction right on the mark? What’s the truth?</font>

378
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:45,290
<font size="40">It was really hot!</font>

379
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:48,630
<font size="40">What about Hoshino? Didn’t you get any burn from that? 
-Are you okay?</font>

380
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:49,830
<font size="40">Yes, I’m fine.</font>

381
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:50,860
<font size="40"><b>Honest.</b></font>

382
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:52,200
<font size="40">Look! She’s completely fine!</font>

383
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:54,870
<font size="40">She’s completely fine!</font>

384
00:23:54,870 --> 00:23:56,530
<font size="40">Don’t make it exaggerated, Takayama-san!</font>
