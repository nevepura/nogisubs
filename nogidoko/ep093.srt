00:00:01,310 --> 00:00:04,080
<font size="40">Tonight, we will show the behind the scene footages 
of Nogizaka46’s participation </font>

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:09,120
<font size="40">in the match between Rakuten and Nippon Ham.</font>

3
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:17,200
<font size="40">The members were appointed to get everyone fired up for the match,</font>

4
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:21,230
<font size="40">In this important match, they need to challenge this nerve-wracking ceremonial first pitch!</font>

5
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,870
<font size="40">I’m nervous right now, but I’ll manage somehow.</font>

6
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:31,240
<font size="40">That superstar will also have a sudden participation!</font>

7
00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:36,750
<font size="40">This fateful ceremonial first-pitch, how will it turn out?</font>

8
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:41,220
<font size="40">Study meeting about certain happenings!</font>

9
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:46,360
<font size="40">Furthermore, tonight, 
Large Idol Family study meeting about certain happenings, final part!</font>

10
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:49,500
<font size="40">It is falling down from the moment I put it on,</font>

11
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,760
<font size="40">In front, you were saying bye bye, but the zipper at the back is…</font>

12
00:00:55,300 --> 00:01:01,110
<font size="40">The troubles of being in a large family, 
then will resentment erupt tonight as well?!</font>

13
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:06,750
<font size="40">Nogizakatte, Doko?</font>

14
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:28,130
<font size="40">DON! Nogizakatte Doko has started, we're your hosts, Bananaman, yoroshiku onegaishimasu!</font>

15
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:31,000
<font size="40">and here are... Nogizaka-chan~</font>

16
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,810
<font size="40">Now then, Himura-san,</font>

17
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:41,780
<font size="40">Please announce what we have for today.</font>

18
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:43,150
<font size="40">Understood. Tonight’s plan is…</font>

19
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:48,150
<font size="40">Let’s support Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles!</font>

20
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:55,900
<font size="40">I heard that the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles...</font>

21
00:01:55,900 --> 00:02:00,670
<font size="40">offered these girls to keep the crowd fired up and throw the ceremonial first-pitch.</font>

22
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:01,870
<font size="40">Really?</font>

23
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,300
<font size="40">It seems we have compiled footages of it.</font>

24
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:07,240
<font size="40">We wanted to see the highlights. Douzo~</font>

25
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:10,740
<font size="40">Let’s support Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles!</font>

26
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:12,650
<font size="40">And for that…</font>

27
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:18,520
<font size="40">The Annual Rakuten Group Day Game will be held on the 9th of July,</font>

28
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:27,230
<font size="40">The group is offered with the ceremonial first pitch and various events 
for the game between Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles and Nippon Ham Fighters.</font>

29
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:33,600
<font size="40">In order for the members to inform their participation in the game,</font>

30
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:41,110
<font size="40">With all of Rakuten’s employee present at the weekly morning assembly, the members got the privilege of expressing their determination.</font>

31
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:42,440
<font size="40">However…</font>

32
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,780
<font size="26">Eh? You’re going here? 
That’s nerve-wracking.</font>

33
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:49,820
<font size="40">Speaking of Rakuten’s company official language, English is their standard.</font>

34
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:53,550
<font size="40">Moreover, the morning assembly where the members will say their greetings</font>

35
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:57,320
<font size="40">is relayed towards all Rakuten employees around the world.</font>

36
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:59,560
<font size="40">This is not good!</font>

37
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:02,930
<font size="40">They received advice from one of Rakuten’s employees,</font>

38
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:04,830
<font size="40">Now, let’s go to that morning assembly!</font>

39
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:07,970
<font size="40">All people of Rakuten all around the world,</font>

40
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:12,100
<font size="40">They barged into the assembly for this important match.</font>

41
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:15,840
<font size="40">Will they be able to ace their English greetings?</font>

42
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:32,190
<font size="26">That’s nice.</font>

43
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:33,060
<font size="40"><b>Positive response.</b></font>

44
00:03:33,060 --> 00:04:08,930
<font size="26">They got a warm reception.</font>

45
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:10,760
<font size="40">Senkyuu berii macchi!</font>

46
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:21,970
<font size="40">They somehow cleared the English greetings garnering favorable impression.</font>

47
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,180
<font size="40">However, the relief from nervousness is just for a brief moment.</font>

48
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:30,480
<font size="40">They all did another greeting to the president of Rakuten, Mikitani,</font>

49
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,180
<font size="40">And right off the bat…</font>

50
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:33,650
<font size="40">Your English was really good!</font>

51
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:34,850
<font size="40"><b>Praise.</b></font>

52
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:36,420
<font size="40">We practiced a lot, right? 
-That’s right.</font>

53
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:39,790
<font size="40">Aim towards being international idols.</font>

54
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:43,200
<font size="40">On the 9th of July, yoroshiku onegaishimasu.</font>

55
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,200
<font size="40">yoroshiku onegaishimasu~</font>

56
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:50,100
<font size="40">Having received words of encouragement from Mikitani-shacho,</font>

57
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:54,470
<font size="40">This offer have to be a success!</font>

58
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:56,280
<font size="40">So, with that…</font>

59
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:59,680
<font size="40">The ceremonial first pitch’s... ball throw?</font>

60
00:04:59,680 --> 00:04:59,950
<font size="40">Amazing!</font>

61
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:01,910
<font size="40"><b>Sloppy right from the start.</b></font>

62
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:04,120
<font size="26">Ball throw?</font>

63
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,080
<font size="40">Ceremonial first pitch.</font>

64
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,120
<font size="26">Who will deliver 
the first pitch?</font>

65
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,850
<font size="40">So it’s just throwing the ball, huh?</font>

66
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:09,460
<font size="40">Okay, okay.</font>

67
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:09,490
<font size="40"><b>Do over.</b></font>

68
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:10,660
<font size="40">So, with that…</font>

69
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:13,190
<font size="40">Appointment suggestion for the one who will deliver the first pitch.</font>

70
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:14,930
<font size="26">A do over?</font>

71
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:17,400
<font size="40">Let’s take a good look!</font>

72
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,400
<font size="40">What do we do? Who should it be?</font>

73
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,970
<font size="40">Right here!</font>

74
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:21,530
<font size="40"><b>Announcing candidacy.</b></font>

75
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:23,500
<font size="40">Ah, double Sayuri.</font>

76
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:26,470
<font size="40">Can you really do it? 
-I can do it.</font>

77
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,840
<font size="40">Both of you are a little bit questionable.</font>

78
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,580
<font size="40">Okay then, I get it.</font>

79
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:31,080
<font size="40">First, I will throw the ball, then Sayunyan will catch it midway and throw it to the catcher.</font>

80
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:35,510
<font size="26">Everyone’s talking all at once.</font>

81
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:36,050
<font size="40"><b>First attempt.</b></font>

82
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:38,450
<font size="26">I’ve never seen anything 
like that in my life.</font>

83
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:42,290
<font size="40">Nanamin, how about you?</font>

84
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:43,360
<font size="40">No, no, I’m good.</font>

85
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:49,460
<font size="40"><b>Keeping distance.</b></font>

86
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:53,370
<font size="40">Various proposals are made for this important ceremonial first pitch.</font>

87
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:56,700
<font size="40">They can’t afford to make it look like a farce!</font>

88
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,300
<font size="40">What if it became…</font>

89
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:01,110
<font size="40">Someone who has experience with throwing will do.</font>

90
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:02,240
<font size="26">Someone with experience?</font>

91
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:02,370
<font size="26">Ah, softball.</font>

92
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:04,910
<font size="40"><b>Experienced with softball.</b></font>

93
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:06,010
<font size="40">I wonder if it will reach~</font>

94
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:09,180
<font size="40">If you’re going to practice throwing for several times, I’ll definitely go with you.</font>

95
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:12,790
<font size="40">Then, somewhere like a batting center.</font>

96
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:14,690
<font size="40"><b>Plans on strengthening batting skills first.</b></font>

97
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:16,160
<font size="40"></font>

98
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:20,590
<font size="40"></font>

99
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:24,000
<font size="40"></font>

100
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,900
<font size="40"></font>

101
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,670
<font size="40">Then, do your best.</font>

102
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:31,170
<font size="40">There we have it, under the condition of having a practice,</font>

103
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:34,940
<font size="40">Shiraishi who has experience in softball will deliver the ceremonial first pitch!</font>

104
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:39,710
<font size="40">Several days later, as preparation for tomorrow’s match, the members are…</font>

105
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:42,950
<font size="40">…not in a batting center, but in Tokyo Dome.</font>

106
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:49,820
<font size="40">So, for tomorrow’s match between the Rakuten and Nippon Ham,</font>

107
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:54,360
<font size="40">I was given the opportunity to deliver the ceremonial first pitch but,</font>

108
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:57,830
<font size="40">We are here right now and we're waiting for a player of the team.</font>

109
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:59,930
<font size="40">That’s right. My heart is pounding right now.</font>

110
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:01,570
<font size="26">Could it be? You're kidding.</font>

111
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:02,600
<font size="40">I’m so nervous.</font>

112
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:06,240
<font size="40">That legendary… pitcher.</font>

113
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,310
<font size="26">Legendary?</font>

114
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:12,850
<font size="40">The members feel nervous, who is this player?</font>

115
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:18,180
<font size="40">Konnichiwa</font>

116
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:19,380
<font size="26">Uwah, that’s great!</font>

117
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:20,520
<font size="26">Are you serious?!</font>

118
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:24,290
<font size="40">That’s right, the one who turned up is a pitcher who represents the baseball world,</font>

119
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:28,460
<font size="40">Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles’ pitcher, Tanaka Masahiro</font>

120
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:29,760
<font size="40">Konnichiwa</font>

121
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:33,600
<font size="40">Ready, set... We are Nogizaka46. yoroshiku onegaishimasu~</font>

122
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,740
<font size="40"><b>Smile.</b></font>

123
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:38,040
<font size="26">Ah, he's smiling.</font>

124
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,670
<font size="26">This is awesome, 
as expected!</font>

125
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:41,910
<font size="40">So cool~</font>

126
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:46,480
<font size="40"><b>Raw impression.</b></font>

127
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:52,920
<font size="40">Although they are feeling sorry for having troubled Tanaka, they asked them pitching tips for the ceremonial first pitch.</font>

128
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,750
<font size="26">That's nice.</font>

129
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:57,990
<font size="40">There’s no point in saying anything that is hard to do.</font>

130
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:04,100
<font size="40">So, throwing it in the easiest and simplest way is the best thing, I believe.</font>

131
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:07,730
<font size="40">In reality, the mound is actually inclined,</font>

132
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:11,000
<font size="40">and the timing is different when throwing from a flat ground.</font>

133
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,470
<font size="26">This is amazing, 
he's considering a lot.</font>

134
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:13,640
<font size="26">Maybe because 
he’s the ace, right?</font>

135
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:19,810
<font size="40">If you can throw it around here with caution, I guess it will be a success.</font>

136
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:22,080
<font size="40">I see. Thank you very much.</font>

137
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:25,380
<font size="40">In addition to that, they kindly asked a request.</font>

138
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:28,650
<font size="40">Can you please take a look at my pitching?</font>

139
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:29,460
<font size="40">Yes, no problem.</font>

140
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:30,320
<font size="40"><b>Comfortably OK.</b></font>

142
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:33,690
<font size="40">Awesome!</font>

143
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:37,000
<font size="40">How luxurious!</font>

144
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,630
<font size="40">Tanaka played catchball with Shiraishi to see her pitching.</font>

145
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,410
<font size="40">Totally looking good.</font>

146
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:47,310
<font size="26">You can do it!</font>

147
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:48,340
<font size="40">sugoi~</font>

148
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:50,440
<font size="40">At that point…</font>

149
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,110
<font size="26">Great, you can even 
catch the ball.</font>

150
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:56,150
<font size="40">It seems like we can use the mound in the stadium for your pitching.</font>

151
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:57,620
<font size="40"><b>Surprising development.</b></font>

152
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:58,620
<font size="26">Awesome!</font>

153
00:08:59,080 --> 00:08:59,320
<font size="26">That’s the best!</font>

154
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,450
<font size="40">Let’s practice over there.</font>

155
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:02,250
<font size="40">onegaishimasu~</font>

156
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:05,720
<font size="26">To practice on the dome’s 
mound is quite something.</font>

157
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,090
<font size="26">That’s true!</font>

158
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:08,160
<font size="40">What a development!</font>

159
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:13,530
<font size="40">In order to grasp what the real game feels like, Shiraishi will practice throwing in the dome’s mound.</font>

160
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:18,100
<font size="40">You raise your legs and throw it hard.</font>

161
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:22,470
<font size="40">Because there’s an inclination right here,</font>

162
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:24,740
<font size="40">the timing is different than on a flat ground,</font>

163
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:26,750
<font size="40">of course it’s easier to plunge forward.</font>

164
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:29,720
<font size="40">You have to throw so that your body won’t plunge into the ground.</font>

165
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,220
<font size="26">What was your position 
in softball?</font>

166
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:31,920
<font size="26">Second base.</font>

167
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:32,780
<font size="26">Second base.</font>

168
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:34,420
<font size="40">Understood.</font>

169
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:37,520
<font size="40">Because there’ll be a lot of fans attending the game,</font>

170
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:40,790
<font size="40">In that situation, you’ll get nervous.</font>

171
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:43,900
<font size="40">You’ll be caught between “I want to throw it” and “I can’t throw it.”</font>

172
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:47,030
<font size="26">There’ll be a lot 
of fans for sure.</font>

173
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:49,200
<font size="40">To get used to the inclination of the mound,</font>

174
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,000
<font size="40">and to overcome nervousness in the game are the important advice she received.</font>

175
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,870
<font size="40">Looking at her on the mound for the very first time…</font>

176
00:09:56,410 --> 00:09:58,340
<font size="40">From here, you look so far!</font>

177
00:09:58,340 --> 00:09:58,480
<font size="40">It’s far~</font>

178
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,150
<font size="40"><b>Renewed sensation.</b></font>

179
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:03,580
<font size="40">It's so far.</font>

180
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,850
<font size="40">By just standing and looking at it, the large distance can be felt.</font>

181
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:10,090
<font size="40">From the middle of the diamond, Shiraishi’s first pitch is…</font>

182
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:12,020
<font size="26">Awesome! Really?!</font>

183
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:14,030
<font size="40"><b>Strike!</b></font>

184
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:14,860
<font size="40">I did it!</font>

185
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:15,760
<font size="26">That one’s a strike!</font>

186
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,030
<font size="40">Isn’t this good enough already?</font>

187
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:22,670
<font size="40">An impressive strike from her first pitch on the dome’s mound!</font>

188
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,100
<font size="40">In addition to that…</font>

189
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,270
<font size="40">Go!</font>

190
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:29,270
<font size="40"><b>Two in a row!</b></font>

191
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:30,380
<font size="26">Seriously?!</font>

192
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:31,310
<font size="40">Yey!</font>

193
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:32,840
<font size="26">It’s already perfect then!</font>

194
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:34,080
<font size="26">Moreover, she has quite a 
control on her throws.</font>

195
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,410
<font size="40">I wonder if I could do this.</font>

196
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:39,280
<font size="40">As expected from Shiraishi who has experience in softball,</font>

197
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:43,460
<font size="40">She has shown pitching that is close to a strike.</font>

198
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:46,790
<font size="40">If you were to throw just like in this practice...</font>

199
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:48,290
<font size="40">Practice. 
-Yes.</font>

200
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,060
<font size="40">With this, you can do no wrong.</font>

201
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:55,430
<font size="40">Shiraishi received an approval from Tanaka,</font>

202
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:58,840
<font size="40">With confidence in her heart, she’ll challenge the ceremonial first pitch!</font>

203
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:03,810
<font size="40">And then, the day of the match between Rakuten and Nippon Ham has finally arrived.</font>

204
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:08,280
<font size="40">Rakuten’s starting pitcher for that day is Tanaka.</font>

205
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:13,590
<font size="40">Confident as expected, he will challenge to get his 12 consecutive win in this important match.</font>

206
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:15,250
<font size="40">Furthermore…</font>

207
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:19,360
<font size="26">There he is!</font>

208
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,060
<font size="40">Ohayou gozaimasu~</font>

209
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:21,930
<font size="26">Manager Hoshino</font>

210
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:23,900
<font size="40">You’re doing the ceremonial first pitch today?</font>

211
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,960
<font size="40">Yes.</font>

212
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,500
<font size="40">Did your pitch reach the plate with this distance?</font>

213
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,470
<font size="40">Yes, it did.</font>

214
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:28,400
<font size="40">Oh, is that so?</font>

215
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,870
<font size="40">You are more amazing than I am!</font>

216
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:34,570
<font size="40">They even reported to Manager Hoshino for the ceremonial first picth. And then…</font>

217
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:35,840
<font size="26">Awesome, right?</font>

218
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:39,440
<font size="40">What am I gonna do?</font>

219
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:46,080
<font size="40">I just thought of telling that we’re doing something extremely incredible right now.</font>

220
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,620
<font size="40">Approaching gradually towards game time,</font>

221
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:52,660
<font size="40">The nervousness is up a notch.</font>

222
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:57,660
<font size="40">And for this day, there are 43,000 in attendance,</font>

223
00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:01,000
<font size="40">she’s under pressure even if she didn’t like it.</font>

224
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:04,670
<font size="40">Because I think there’ll be a lot in attendance,</font>

225
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:07,170
<font size="40">I'm really nervous</font>

226
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:13,550
<font size="40">Of course, because there are members and players around me,</font>

227
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:19,080
<font size="40">I’m nervous right now, but I’ll manage somehow.</font>

228
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:23,620
<font size="40">Can Shiraishi overcome this nervousness?</font>

229
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:28,630
<font size="40">And will she be able to deliver a successful ceremonial first pitch?</font>

230
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,730
<font size="40">Finally, the fateful ceremonial first pitch.</font>

231
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:41,040
<font size="40">I’m nervous right now, but I’ll manage somehow.</font>

232
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:46,910
<font size="40">Rakuten bestowed a ceremonial first pitch offer for this important match.</font>

233
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:52,550
<font size="40">In order to make that task successful, Shiraishi did a complete preparation.</font>

234
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:54,520
<font size="40">The nervousness before the match,</font>

235
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:58,160
<font size="40">and the pressure from the big crowd is overwhelming.</font>

236
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:04,430
<font size="40">Will Shiraishi be able to make this important ceremonial first pitch a success?</font>

237
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:08,870
<font size="40">The fated moment has come.</font>

238
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:13,440
<font size="40">Next, Rakuten Group Day Fans Thanksgiving 2013</font>

239
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,870
<font size="40">We’ll conduct the ceremonial first pitch!</font>

240
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:17,740
<font size="40">To deliver today’s ceremonial first pitch is Nogizaka46’s Shiraishi Mai!</font>

241
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:20,880
<font size="26">Awesome and frightening.</font>

242
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,110
<font size="26">This is really amazing!</font>

243
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:25,880
<font size="26">Ah, everyone’s 
cheering her on.</font>

244
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:41,000
<font size="40">Well then, please go ahead.</font>

245
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:46,300
<font size="40">I’m quite nervous but,</font>

246
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:48,970
<font size="40">After a few days of practice,</font>

247
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:51,940
<font size="40">and because I was taught how to throw,</font>

248
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,380
<font size="40">I’m sure that everything will be alright.</font>

249
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:56,210
<font size="40">With this, you can do no wrong.</font>

250
00:13:57,050 --> 00:13:58,280
<font size="40">To what extent do you have confidence?</font>

251
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:01,620
<font size="40">I have confidence!</font>

252
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:05,520
<font size="40">With Tanaka who oversaw her practice and Manager Hoshino,</font>

253
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:08,230
<font size="40">along with baseball stars representing the baseball world,</font>

254
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:10,800
<font size="40">and with the big crowd watching attentively,</font>

255
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,230
<font size="40">Challenge the string of fate!</font>

256
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:17,500
<font size="40">Where will the ball really go?</font>

257
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:22,710
<font size="26">You're kidding, right?!</font>

258
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:23,910
<font size="26">What happened?</font>

259
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:27,280
<font size="40">What an ending!</font>

260
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:32,780
<font size="40">The ball pitched by Shiraishi is a wild pitch which bounced twice.</font>

261
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:34,150
<font size="26">You lost your strength?</font>

262
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:38,190
<font size="26">You were knocked 
down completely.</font>

263
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:38,620
<font size="40"><b>Sinking.</b></font>

264
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:40,030
<font size="40">Dealing with a lot of shock,</font>

265
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:42,790
<font size="40">she crouched down on the mound.</font>

266
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,960
<font size="40">It was really frustrating.</font>

267
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,770
<font size="40">Really..</font>

268
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:55,140
<font size="40">Just plain frustrating.</font>

269
00:14:55,870 --> 00:15:00,180
<font size="40">There’s too much frustration that she shed a lot of tears right after the ceremonial first pitch.</font>

270
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:04,480
<font size="40">However, after seeing that, on Tanaka’s blog is…</font>

271
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:07,220
<font size="40">I saw her disappointed appearance,</font>

272
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:09,650
<font size="40">But I think she seriously made an effort for it.</font>

273
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:11,220
<font size="40">It was fun, wasn’t it?</font>

274
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:14,290
<font size="40">Such kind words…</font>

275
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:18,500
<font size="40">For Shiraishi, it was a ceremonial first pitch where regrets will remain.</font>

276
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,800
<font size="40">Game’s all good, playball! And then…</font>

277
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:23,770
<font size="40">Here's Sakurai Reika.</font>

281
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:35,010
<font size="26">What’s up with that? 
That’s awesome!</font>

282
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:36,010
<font size="40">Ok, #7.</font>

284
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:47,360

in the Major League.</font>

285
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:48,960
<font size="26">They even performed 
their song.</font>

286
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:57,670
<font size="26">You even did this? 
That's amazing!</font>

287
00:15:57,670 --> 00:16:00,540
<font size="40">It was fun.</font>

288
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:06,510
<font size="40">Live performance, stadium DJ and cheerleading, Did their cheers somehow reach the players?</font>

289
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:10,720
<font size="40">Tanaka achieved his 12th consecutive win with an unblemished record.</font>

290
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,690
<font size="40">Remarkably, the Rakuten Eagles had a complete game victory!</font>

291
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:21,260
<font size="40">Whether it contributed to the victory or not, the Eagles cheering plan finished safely.</font>

292
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:25,830
<font size="40">That was nice. 
-It was amazing, right?</font>

293
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:28,700
<font size="40">I’m so jealous of you. 
-Not just the ceremonial first pitch but you also did a lot of things.</font>

294
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,470
<font size="40"></font>

295
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:33,670
<font size="40">Having Ma-kun to teach you is the best.</font>

296
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:35,010
<font size="40">It’s just that, it was frustrating, the pitch…</font>

297
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,840
<font size="40">Yes, it was.</font>

298
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:39,840
<font size="40">What happened? How did it turn out like that?</font>

299
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:43,380
<font size="40">When I saw the crowd, I got completely nervous.</font>

300
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:46,180
<font size="40">I was even taught how to grip the ball.</font>

301
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:49,220
<font size="40">But I don’t remember it anymore when I stood right there.</font>

302
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:52,820
<font size="40">But I exerted not much force, and the timing is off.</font>

303
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:54,760
<font size="40">Embarrassing, right?</font>

304
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:56,590
<font size="40">Yes, it is!</font>

305
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:58,960
<font size="40">That’s why you jumped and crouched.</font>

306
00:16:58,960 --> 00:16:59,930
<font size="40"><b>Losing Pitcher.</b></font>

307
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:01,700
<font size="40">But it wasn’t supposed to be like this!</font>

308
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:03,600
<font size="40">Yes, it was something like that.</font>

309
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:08,070
<font size="40">But it was good, it was a great experience, right?</font>

310
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:13,550
<font size="40">After this, Large idol group study meeting about certain happenings… Final part!</font>

311
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:20,590
<font size="40">Previously, we had “Large Idol Family study meeting about certain happenings.”</font>

312
00:17:20,590 --> 00:17:24,920
<font size="40">My grandmother often says “Nogizaka appeared right there, huh?”</font>

313
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,130
<font size="40">I didn’t sing! Moreover, I didn’t even appear!</font>

314
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:33,830
<font size="40">From the worries they accumulate day by day came an unexpected roar of laughter.</font>

315
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:38,270
<font size="40">These situations can't be covered with just one episode.</font>

316
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:44,480
<font size="40">With that, continuing from last week, this week too.. 
Large Family Happenings, Start!</font>

317
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,040
<font size="40">Let’s move on…</font>

318
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,410
<font size="40">The next happening is this.</font>

319
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:49,710
<font size="40">Similar casual clothes.</font>

320
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:51,750
<font size="40">For casual clothes, this is unacceptable.</font>

321
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:52,880
<font size="40">Who wrote this one?</font>

322
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:55,490
<font size="40">Ah, Akimoto, what do you mean?</font>

323
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:59,090
<font size="40">In handshake events, having similar clothes is acceptable, but…</font>

324
00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:01,290
<font size="40">Even with everyday casual clothes, there is someone who wear quite similar clothes with others.</font>

325
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:02,990
<font size="40">What do you mean? 
-Something like doing imitation of others?</font>

326
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:03,290
<font size="40">Copying others’ fashion.</font>

327
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:04,500
<font size="40">Hhmm, well, there’s also that…</font>

328
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,500
<font size="40">Is this really happening often?</font>

329
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:10,000
<font size="40">There’s only one member who often wear quite similar clothes with me.</font>

330
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,170
<font size="40">Ah, similar with Akimoto?</font>

331
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:11,670
<font size="40">Who is it?</font>

332
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:13,170
<font size="40">It's Sakurai.</font>

333
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:18,140
<font size="40">Something like your tastes have the similar look.</font>

334
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:21,780
<font size="40">Basically, I’ve always been wearing the same type of clothes, but,</font>

335
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:25,450
<font size="40">Sakurai is a bit different at first, she is somewhat a cool type.</font>

336
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:26,950
<font size="40">Ah, she’s the type who imitates other people!</font>

337
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:28,920
<font size="40"><b>Reference.</b></font>

338
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:33,160
<font size="40">I wonder if she’s getting closer to me.</font>

339
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:33,960
<font size="40">I see.</font>

340
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:36,660
<font size="40">Wait. Are you wearing clothes same to that of Manatsu?</font>

341
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:38,960
<font size="40">That happened quite a lot.</font>

342
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:44,470
<font size="40">After all, with the amount of money that people our age can spend,</font>

343
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:48,640
<font size="40">then there is a trend to consider as well,</font>

344
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,610
<font size="40">and the places to go shopping are also limited.</font>

345
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:54,210
<font size="40">Are you doing an imitation of Manatsu-san?</font>

346
00:18:54,410 --> 00:18:55,610
<font size="40">No, I’m not!</font>

347
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:57,650
<font size="40">Just a coincidence? 
-I’m definitely not!</font>

348
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,450
<font size="40">So Manatsu-san is just an excessively self-conscious person, right?</font>

349
00:18:59,450 --> 00:18:59,850
<font size="40"><b>Excessively Self-conscious Person.</b></font>

350
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:02,790
<font size="40">That’s not true, you know!</font>

351
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:05,590
<font size="40">I don’t think that it really matter but,</font>

352
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:09,460
<font size="40">But to be frank, if Himura-san showed up to work with the same clothes I’m wearing,</font>

353
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:10,830
<font size="40">I would hate it.</font>

354
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:13,930
<font size="40">It’s fine but…</font>

355
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:18,470
<font size="40">If you really hate it then, tell the shop clerk that “If any Nogizaka member came by, don’t ever sell this to them.”</font>

356
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:18,470

375
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:03,380
<font size="40">Quick change during live shows</font>

376
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:07,050
<font size="40">Is there some incident about this? Who wrote this?</font>

377
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:09,120
<font size="40">We have high hopes.</font>

378
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:14,930
<font size="40">For example, it does happen during live, right?</font>

379
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:14,930
<font size="40"><b>For example?</b></font>

380
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:16,660
<font size="40">Yes. For example: live concerts and such.</font>

381
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:23,030
<font size="40">Not just during live, we have to change clothes quickly.</font>

382
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:25,400
<font size="40">Because the outfits are not always the same right?</font>

383
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:30,440
<font size="40">Then, really, for about 40 seconds, we have to finish changing. Is it forty?</font>

384
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:33,410
<font size="40">Well, it seems that we have to finish changing with that time limit, something like that.</font>

385
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:36,950
<font size="40">During the live performance, on the stage,</font>

386
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:38,620
<font size="40">Because I was in a real hurry,</font>

387
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:40,520
<font size="40">On my way, my clothes came off, and I thought that it was no good.</font>

388
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:43,760
<font size="40">I was holding the zipper firmly on my back.</font>

389
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,920
<font size="40">Right on the stage?</font>

390
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,290
<font size="40">It is falling down from the moment I put it on,</font>

391
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:51,030
<font size="40">In front, I’m saying bye bye. It was during the encore.</font>

392
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:53,130
<font size="40">In front, you were saying bye bye, but the zipper at the back is…</font>

<font size="40">That’s awesome!</font>

395
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:00,040
<font size="40">While being sociable,</font>

396
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:02,010
<font size="40">I’m saying bye bye a lot.</font>

397
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:05,240
<font size="40">This part came down and opened up.</font>

398
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,980
<font size="40">Because there are a lot of people, I can’t turn around. 
-Because she can’t zip it on her own.</font>

399
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:11,020
<font size="40">You have to acquire a technique to do it.</font>

400
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:18,820
<font size="40">Certainly, there’s a great difference between being near close to the crowd and away from them.</font>

401
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:21,190
<font size="40">Basically, those in the front row will gather together.</font>

402
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:24,100
<font size="40">Then those at the back are like…</font>

<font size="40"><b>No consideration.</b></font>

405
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:30,130
<font size="40">That’s enough! It’s unnecessary!</font>

406
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:35,010
<font size="40">Wait a sec, idols have to wave their hands.</font>

407
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:39,380
<font size="40">That would be a big deal for the fans.</font>

408
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:43,210
<font size="40">Most people, they’ll do this.</font>

409

415

00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:52,580
<font size="40">Everyone’s faces are serious.</font>

442
00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:55,050
<font size="40">“Aa~ Strawberry~ ♥”</font>

443
00:22:55,690 --> 00:22:56,520
<font size="40">Pride of lions aiming at their prey.</font>

444
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:57,860
<font size="40"></font>

445
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:00,220
<font size="40">So it won’t get eaten away.</font>

446
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:02,060
<font size="40">So it won’t get eaten away, because there’s a lot of you, right?</font>

447
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:02,990
<font size="40">Yes. 
-Strawberry.</font>

448
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:07,230
<font size="40">We’re doing kawaii faces but our obsession for food is too much.</font>

449
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:10,440
<font size="40">You also like eating huh?</font>

450
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:13,740
<font size="40">When idols pig out, they also get fat, right?</font>

451
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:17,710
<font size="40">In the case of AKB48, everyone got fat so they banned it.</font>

452
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:18,610
<font size="40"><b>Supply of provisions banned.</b></font>

453
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:20,110
<font size="40">The supply of provisions.</font>

454
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:21,150
<font size="40">It was banned. 
-Banned?</font>

455
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:22,550
<font size="40">Eh? Why?</font>

456
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:26,520
<font size="40">Because everyone do nothing but eat, then the innocent ones eat more.</font>

457
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,390
<font size="40">Our brains are fat, therefore,</font>

458
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:31,660
<font size="40">I will want it by just appreciating it visually!</font>

459
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:32,990
<font size="40">-I know how you feel!</font>

460
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:35,990
<font size="40">”Just a piece of this, and also a piece of this.” I’ll do something like that.</font>

461
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:38,200
<font size="40">Then I’ll say ”I will eat this with everyone!”</font>

462
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,760
<font size="40">But I’ll end up eating most of it.</font>

463
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:40,400
<font size="40">Stealing food from others’ share.</font>

464
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,230
<font size="40">I get that!</font>

465
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:44,230
<font size="40"></font>
