Must be me.

51
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,300
This is most likely Matsumura.

52
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:47,120
It's all matched with me.

53
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,100

You think so?

74
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,100
This is the first time i'm being told like this.

75
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:55,390
Have you never think of yourself pretty and stylish?

76
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:56,610
Never.

77
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,580
Really?

78
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:07,230
Now since Yamazaki said that to you,
you'll definitely remember her than the others.

79
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:08,330
Certainly ^^

80
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,880
Good. Let's continue it like this.

81
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:16,580
Now let's get to the next one.

82
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,660
Her face is my type, a good sense of humour, i really like it.

83
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,230
Who is this?

84
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:24,880
There is a sense of humour.

85
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:27,530
This!

86
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,460
Ummm... EEEE^^

87
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:41,630
My face.. isn't based on the general opinion,
It is just her personal taste.

88
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:43,610
So happy.

89
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:45,360
Who is this?

90
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:47,490
Ah!

91
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:48,880
Karin.

92
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:54,190
From the start, since she rubbed her elbow in the first event...

93
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:56,040
Eh!? Since that time?

94
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,010
Of course.

95
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:58,110
Even you're also lined up for the handshake right?

96
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,250
Yup.

97
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:01,280
Takayama, you remember her?

98
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:07,300
Yes, at 2nd gen first introduction,
Karin entered the room first.

99
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:08,060
Yup.

100
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:16,150
I think her face is familiar.. And when her name called,
Itou Karin, i was like EEEEEHH i know this girl.

101
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:21,240
What's your impression of Takayama's handshake?

102
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:25,210
When i came in, she greeted me "waaa Karin chan".

103
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:28,280
She remember you?

104
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:34,750
Just Sometimes... Maybe she's confuse
because there's too many people.

105
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:40,610
But, since you're together now, her charm
will going back to normal again for you, right?

106
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:42,240
Why? ^^

107
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:45,280
Right? All this time You're always
want to meet her but you can't.

108
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:47,220
Is there anything you wanna do with Takayama?

109
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:54,820
Well i love to talk too, i want to appear
in a Talk show together.

110
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:56,050
Talk show...

111
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:56,770
Yes.

112
00:05:56,770 --> 00:06:00,610
Im not good at Talk show, actually.

113
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,370
Hey, this is your skill.

114
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:06,240
Heh! Not at all!

115
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:07,680
Takayama, please tell us an interesting story.

116
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,020
Nothing. Nothing. Nothing.

117
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:14,720

118
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:17,490

Wait! Why end up like this? Wait!

121
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,280
Scary...

122
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,540
You're not so smart.

123
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,980
I really can't!

124
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:34,690
I think no one can handle that pass too.

125
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:35,960
Thank god.

126
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:38,640
Let's check out the next one.

127
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:44,120

Finally appear. Matsumura!

129
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:49,040
Who is this?

130
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,580
Yonetoku, so you think Sayuringo punch is lame?

131
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,240
Why? it's not lame ^^

132
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,850
Basically she's cute. Even her lame joke.

133
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:00,320
That character is cute?

134
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,050
Kawaii.

135
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:05,570
Kawaii but how about her gag "sayuringo punch"?

136
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,180
What "sayuringo punch"?

137
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:13,880
"Sayuringo Punch" is... SAYURINGO PU---NCH<3

138
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:17,180
Why?

139
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:20,460
You just saw "sayuringo punch" live, right? How is it?

140
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:24,060
I can feel the innocence image, like usual.

141
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,620
Can feel the innocence image...

142
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:29,120
So how is it? Good or lame?

143
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:34,520
We don't have to talk about that, right?
It's nothing to do with good or lame.

144
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:37,780
Is there anything else that you like from Matsumura?

145
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:40,690
Character, and of course.. her face.

146
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,610
How is this... I'm shy...

147
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:47,330
You're so happy when someone says
you're face are pretty.

148
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:54,940
Let's see the next one.

149
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:02,250
Her sing and dance is very good.
As a captain, she led and respected by the members.

150
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,240
Members doesn't respect her.

151
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,200
There is someone who think like that.

152
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,250
Eh, not respected by the members?

153
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:08,620
No.

154
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,840
No, they respect me all the time.

155
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:14,880
And she doesn't lead. It's all lie.

156
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:19,180
Members are often gathered by themselves, and she came late.
She doesn't lead the members.

157
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:20,010
Wrong!

158
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:21,010
Come late.

159
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:25,640
No, i escort the member to the destinaion
and then i go after them.

160
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:26,800
No, no, must be a lie.

161
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,570
It's true.

162
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,730
Who wrote this?

163
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:31,200
Yes.

164
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:32,540
Oh, Yada.

165
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:42,210
We have the same age, i can't be like her.
When i saw her on TV, she's so independent.

166
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,700
Independent?

167
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:44,360
Yes.

168
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:53,200
She doesn't lead in the right way?
But you respect her, right?

169
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:54,010
No.

170
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:55,840
What's this?

171
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:58,650
I respect her singing and dancing skills.

172
00:08:58,650 --> 00:08:59,740
Her sing and dance is good?

173
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:00,450
Very good.

174
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:02,930
But, other than that there is nothing...

175
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:08,410
Right, in weak point episode, you're willing to be mocked.

176
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:12,440
Hmmm? Sakurai, You're not trusted by them?

177
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:18,820
They trust me. I always bear all the burden.
Why you all laugh...

178
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:22,080
But, members doesn't feel like that.

179
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:25,290
Even so, it's 2 years already.

180
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:30,600
Let's continue. The next one is...

181
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,620
Which member has the most gap?

182
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:35,890
Oh, gap...

183
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:41,800
Members who have distinct impression
when seen and encountered is...

184
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:45,300
Wakatsuki.

185
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:48,770
You do not seem to have a gap.

186
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:52,500
Alright Wakatsuki, so far how many members
that you've been bullying?

187
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:59,050
Wrong? You didn't do it?

188
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:00,060
No.

189
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:02,330
OK, let's see.

190
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:05,660
Who write that she had distinct impression for Wakatsuki?

191
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,170
Itou, what kind of gap?

192
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:17,240
When i saw her on TV, she looks so firm.

193
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,100
Eh, really...

194
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:19,700
Why...

195
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:29,530
But, during introductions, she's so kind.
She must be a very kind person.

196
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,900
I see.

197
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:33,520
I see, so it's a positive gap.

198
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:37,500
Anything else? Other gap...

199
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:49,400
When we showed up at principal, im so nervous.
And there is a snack and drink for members. It's so hard to grab it.

200
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:56,170
When im confuse, suddenly Wakatsuki come and said
"Let's grab it together".

201
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,690
Ah right.. you went there together.

202
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:06,960
And she asked "Is the drink enough? You're a member too, just take it."

203
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:10,490
I'm really impressed.

204
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:14,130
At that time, you must be so happy.

205
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:14,980
Yeah, so happy.

206
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:16,970
When you have no idea...

207
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:20,250
You have a good gap... isn't there anything else?

208
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:24,660
A good gap.

209
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:32,800
When we saw the rehearsal,
Wakatsuki come to our place at break time.

210
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,820
Oh, you even did such thing...

211
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,120
Come to your place.

212
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,900
And then with cheerful face she said, nice to meet you.

213
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:42,050
So, the other members doesn't come?

214
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:44,720
Ah, a few moments later they came...

215
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,740
Other members came too, but Wakatsuki came first.

216
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:53,640
Wakatsuki, What is this? Awesome...

217
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:59,040
But, Wakatsuki in the waiting room,
seems like she want to be liked by them very much.

218
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:02,440
Wrong, Wrong, Mattsun!

219
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:06,800
I see, this is the first time, so she want to be liked.

220
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:10,100
Yes, we don't know whether we can go there or not.

221
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:12,620
If you know it's allowed,
You would like to go there too for sure.

222
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:13,880
Yes.

223
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,380
Wakatsuki, you're exaggerate.

224
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:17,010
Wrong!

225
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:21,180
Seems like you want to hangout with 2nd gen
and be nice to them so...

226
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:25,010
Why end up like this...

227
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,040
But why?

228
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:34,780
Me too, i joined school club in middle shool,
I simply could not carry on a conversation.

229
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:43,140
Senior is senior, it's always like this.
This has always been a problem, and i know they feel it too.

230
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:48,380
That's why, senior should talk to them.

231
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:51,500
I always think that you're not such a good person.

232
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,960
EEEEEEHHHHHH although it's been 2 years...

233
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,500
Apparently you're a good person.

234
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:00,540
If compared to Matsumura...

235
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,900
You want to be liked by them.

236
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:07,840
No, no, i'm a good person, right? ^^
You know that, right? ^^

237
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,260
OK.

238
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:10,810
Next question!

239
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:14,930
1st gen members who are very had to be approached.

240
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:18,600
This is a problem. Members who are hard to be approached.

241
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,780
Who do you think?

242
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:23,320
Maybe Ikoma?

243
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:25,460
Ikoma? Why?

244
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:33,100
It's hard for me to open myself to the people
whom i first met. I just can't start it.

245
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:39,900
Coming up, Surprisingly, the name that called is...!!

246
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:46,960
Is Ikoma name will appear? Who's 1st gen members
who are very had to approached?

247
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,080
Wrong. Hashimoto!

248
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:57,500
Hmm... Hashimoto, I knew why she was so hard to be approached.

249
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:58,800
Hashimoto can not?

250
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,620
Who is this?

251
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:03,580
Hori speaks.

252
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:11,080
Hashimoto's image is smart, looks like she'll
give me a difficult words to understand.

253
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,080
Hmmm... That's Right.

254
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:18,900
I'm not too familiar with difficult words.
I'm afraid i don't get the conversation's topic.

255
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,900
I see, so it's the topic.

256
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:25,660
In the question form, maybe she will give
a difficult words or a proverb...

257
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:27,060
No.

258
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:29,160
Proverb, eh...

259
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:32,280
Hashimoto like proverb, right...

260
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,440
I never said that.

261
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:40,720
Needless to say but her image said so.

262
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,440
Yes.

263
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,440
That would be so hard to connect.

264
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,620
How old are you?

265
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:45,660
16.

266
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:47,660
You wanna give a proverb?

267
00:14:53,920 --> 00:15:00,000
Next, we still have Members who are hard to be approached.

268
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,960
AKIMOTO!

269
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:07,640
Akimoto. Who is this?

270
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:08,500
Yes.

271
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,200
Nishikawa...

272
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,180
Nishikawa-san^^

273
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:17,440
Nishikawa is the same age as her.

274
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,400
Middle school, right?

275
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:19,060
Yes.

276
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:22,380
Same school and the same club.

277
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,880
This is awesome!

278
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,880
Cool.

279
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,410
It's true, right?

280
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:41,520
Right, in the school, we talk with everyday language.
Now it's senior-junior, im confused how to talk with her.

281
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:45,170
The position changed.

282
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,080
Right...

283
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,940
You haven't talked to each other, right?

284
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:53,710
Ah, we met in our latest show. At that time...

285
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:55,220
Wait. Please listen to me.

286
00:15:55,220 --> 00:16:11,570
Um, at least now i'm the senior and Nanami is junior.
But in school, Nanami is in the funky group, while im in the ordinary one.

287
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:15,480
I see, There always such a group in school.

288
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,250
The funky group...

289
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:20,450
The funky group, and im in the ordinary one. That's why.

290
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:22,250
The group isn't talk much.

291
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:23,310
Who?

292
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:24,310
Manatsu san.

293
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:25,540
The plain group?

294
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:28,460
No!

295
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:33,950
So it's not the group that you know well.

296
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:36,710
Yes. I feel there is a little gap...

297
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:38,910
That's why, you're the one who worried?

298
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:47,200
Yes, i don't know what to do. But she called me just now.
I'll use this name to get close with her.

299
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:52,350
And then, the one who had junior-senior relation too.. Ah!

300
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:53,930
High School...

301
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:55,400
Your High School senior?

302
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,240
Yes.

303
00:16:56,350 --> 00:17:00,110
It's quite interesting. She think, Manatsu-senpai...

304
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:11,150
She's student council leader. And when she became nogizaka member,
When me and my friend saw her at the station, "Look it's Manatsu-san"

305
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:15,020
In your hometown, everyone is like,
"Manatsu-san.. Manatsu-san"

306
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:19,710
I never thought I'd be noticed that much.

307
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:22,400
Manatsu-san had been washed down in waterfall.

308
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:24,310
You're being discussed.

309
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:27,660
Manatsu-san are going to do skydiving.

310
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:29,680
That isn't something to be proud of.

311
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:30,730
It's like degawa..

312
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:31,570
Yeah right!

313
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:38,620
Here we have the young one who became senior
And there we also have the older one.

314
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:40,530
How is it then? In one group...

315
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:42,240
What's the rules in the idol world?

316
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:43,800
Don't really know...

317
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:50,640
In comedy industry, if there's a young comedian but he
entered the industry before you, then he's your senior.

318
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:52,210
Comedy industry is like that.

319
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:53,650
Ah, right. Let's make it like that.

320
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:56,540
Nogizaka want to be like that too?

321
00:17:56,980 --> 00:18:00,400
Ikoma-chan want to be senior too.

322
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,040
So even there's older one, you're the senior?

323
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:03,740
Yes.

324
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:06,120
So.. Ah please go on.

325
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:14,530
How do we call them? For example Matsumura-san,
should we call her Matsumura-san, Sayurin-san or Ringo-san...

326
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:16,530
Her name isn't Rino, right!?

327
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:18,640
So...

328
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:26,380
Ah, for the members who has a nickname,
Should we call them by their nickname or what?

329
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,690
Ah, actully i have a name...

330
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:30,040
Oh, there is!?

331
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:34,220
Finally i can say it.

332
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:37,890
I want all of you to call me Ringo-hime.

333
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:42,240
Errr... Sounds so wrong at this time...

334
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:44,280
Why!? It's the topic, right?

335
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,120
Ringo-hime?

336
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,120
So, everyone should call you Ringo-hime ??

337
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:48,700
Yes.

338
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:52,140
Is that okay? Even when you're 40-50 years old
and still called Ringo-hime.

339
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,720
Maybe it's better if we give the special name to Ikuta.

340
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,260
Ikuta is just like a princess.

341
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:59,180
Erika-sama.

342
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:01,020
She will be angry if you don't call her Erika-sama.

343
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:04,530
No, no, just .. let's be friendly.

344
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:08,770
Ok, the next question form...

345
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:13,820
I'm not confidence with my PR,
Please give me advice.

346
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:14,740
Who's this?

347
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:21,080
PR huh? Please show it first.

348
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:26,480
When i say Itou, You'll say Junna.

349
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:33,880
Konpeitou konpeitou konpeitou konpe ITOU!

350
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,220
Junna!

351
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:36,460
