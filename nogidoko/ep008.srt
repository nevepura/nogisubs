1
00:00:01,420 --> 00:00:05,840
In tonight's Nogidoko, the members try out acting for the first time!

2
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:09,730
Their enthusiasm goes beyond expectations!

3
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:13,370
It's okay if you don't listen to the adults!

4
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:15,570
A sea of criticism comes out from Katsumata's mouth!

5
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:18,540
And miraculous scenes will show themselves!

6
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:20,520
What is that!

7
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:24,060
Himura goes amok in the studio!

9
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:46,840
DON!!

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,260
Nogidoko has begun, we're your hosts Bananaman!

11
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:57,960
And here are the members of Nogizaka46!

12
00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:00,200
Yay!

13
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:07,200
These 3 members make their appearance on Nogidoko for the 1st time

14
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:11,400
And today's guest is Katsumata!

15
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,840
I'll be in your care! BAM!

16
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:19,760
You know, Katsumata in this world of showbiz, is known as "The Planner"

17
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:21,000
Remember this!

18
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:25,200
When they decide the members of a meeting ..

19
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:27,530
He's always included!

20
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:30,730
Because he's the person who came up with that plan

21
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:31,520
That's right!

22
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:32,960
This is true!

23
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:34,320
Is this amount of praising your accolades enough?

24
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:35,360
Thank you very much!

25
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,470
No problem!

26
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:37,640
But it's true, honestly!

27
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:40,660
Whatever is said or done, Katsumata has a hand in it!

28
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,040
It would be okay!

29
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:46,130
So today's plan for welcoming Katsumata is this!

30
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:50,630
Nogizaka46 1st acting experience!

31
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:58,640
From now on, there would definitely be drama opportunities for you all

32
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,260
The opportunities would definitely come very soon

33
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,400
For this time, the situation would be decided beforehand

34
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:06,940
There wasn't any script right?

35
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:07,040
Wow, that's awesome

36
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,350
They had to ad lib?

37
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:10,190
I'm looking forward to this

38
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:11,900
The first situation is this

39
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:15,460
「 Shouting towards the sea to snap out of a broken heart 」

40
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,210
The ending would be the best scene for this topic right?

41
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:18,480
That's true

42
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,220
The last part is going to be anticipated right?

43
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,000
First up, what kind of acting would she show us?

44
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,080
Wow, nice!

45
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:27,890
Oh! This somehow looks good!

46
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:29,540
Cute~!

47
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:30,700
Why?

48
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:32,480
Oh, the scene has started

49
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,910
You said that you would only love me!

50
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:36,900
Oh! This is good!

51
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,960
I won't fall in love ever again!

52
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,000
Your lines weren't decided for this?

53
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,420
Yes

54
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:48,220
That's amazing!

55
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:51,650
Next up is Inoue's first acting experience!

56
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:55,850
You have to think of your own lines right?

57
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:59,640
Don't leave me alone!

58
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:00,650
Ah?

59
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:01,760
Not bad

60
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:03,680
You said we would be together forever!

61
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:03,850
Is she crying?

62
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,060
You promised me that right here!

63
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:09,860
Stupid!

64
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,760
What would Ikoma from Akita's first acting be like?

65
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:24,000
She seems cool and composed

66
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:25,250
This is good

67
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:25,770
I wonder what's in her pocket

68
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,600
What's that?

69
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,330
What is that?

70
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:30,560
A sweet wrapper?

71
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:31,680
What did she throw?

72
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,320
What did she throw?

73
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:34,250
What did you throw?

74
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:34,960
Goodbye

75
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
What did you throw?
I want to know too

76
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:38,890
She looked at the camera

77
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:40,710
You looked at the camera!

78
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:41,860
I wonder what did she throw into the ocean

79
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:45,650
Matsumura from Osaka, what would she say while facing the sea?

80
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:48,670
Matsumura

81
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:53,760
Why did you leave me?

82
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:58,200
What's wrong with being an otaku?

83
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:02,890
It's obvious I love you more than anime!

84
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:06,770
Why won't you understand?

85
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:09,950
On a whole, they are pretty good at acting!

86
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,550
They composed themselves well
I was surprised!

87
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:14,700
I thought you all would be super lousy at acting

88
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:15,400
Not bad!

89
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,530
Not bad at all!

90
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:18,860
What is this? Amazing!

91
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:19,970
Isn't Shiraishi darn good?

92
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:20,330
You're good!

93
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:22,480
Really? Thank you very much!

94
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:25,440
You didn't have a script right? What you said was at the spur of the moment right?

95
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:26,140
Yes

96
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,150
That's amazing!

97
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:28,480
And Inoue

98
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,000
You were good

99
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:30,730
Ah, Really?

100
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:31,770
You were very good

101
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:33,170
You kicked the sand right?

102
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:38,040
Was it your plan to kick the sand or did it happen because your emotion level went higher?

103
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,730
Honestly, I wanted to jump into the ocean

104
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:41,790
THAT'S IT!

105
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:44,820
I thought that if there was a girl that did that, it would be amazing!

106
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,000
If she went into the ocean right?

107
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,300
It's just a small segment, but if there was a girl that would do that, she's a STAR!

108
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,260
I see!

109
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:54,600
I was thinking "GO FOR IT!"

110
00:04:54,610 --> 00:05:01,550
I know someone who is like that, he overreacts to a small matter and blows things up in a freestyle way

111
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:06,750
And then, he once licked an amateur grandpa comedian's shoes all over

112
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:09,930
I thought that there would be no one able to win him in this area, and this person is Himura

113
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:11,130
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT ME!

114
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:12,880
THAT'S ME!

115
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:14,860
But it's about things like this right?

116
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:16,020
You had the feeling to do the same thing right?

117
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:16,170
Yes

118
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:17,510
Why did you decide not to?

119
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:22,770
I didn't want to get my uniform wet and our standing positions were decided beforehand ..

120
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:25,350
You can just push aside and not care about what the adults decide!!

121
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:30,040
There's a comedian duo called Fusoto No. 55, and in the past, the camera's angle was limited

122
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:34,250
The norm was to suit the camera's angle, but they performed their skits out of the camera's view!

123
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,770
Oh! I see

124
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:38,710
But they thought that they would be scolded for that so they ran away, but the producer chased them

125
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,620
And told them "Your skit is interesting so please come back and perform it once more"

126
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:41,820
EHHHH~

127
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,500
And from then on they became regulars on the show

128
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:47,460
In that context, it was good that we didn't know what Ikoma-chan threw

129
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:48,620
But .. what did you throw?

130
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:49,800
It was a pebble I picked from the ground

131
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,220
You threw a pebble you found on the ground?

132
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:55,510
I saw the pebble on the ground, and I thought to myself "Yay!"

133
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:58,060
So I thought it would be great if I used the pebble for the acting scene

134
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:59,570
Oh, I see!

135
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:02,680
You didn't show us the pebble, but you made eye contact with the camera right?

136
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,750
I merely glanced momentarily at the camera

137
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:04,770
Did you watch the last part?

138
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,640
Making eye contact with the camera is the thing you should not do!

139
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:09,530
Making eye contact with the camera is a no-no!

140
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:12,860
Please watch the replay of the problem-scene

141
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:15,570
Goodbye

142
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:17,570
This scene is good too as the lines were short and sweet

143
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:18,000
Wait a moment, shes looking into the camera

144
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,390
Totally looking at the camera

145
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:20,930
You looked directly into the camera once

146
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:22,700
It was obvious from that, that I didn't look at the camera isn't it?

147
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:24,130
No, there was once that you definitely looked into the camera

148
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:24,800
What did you look at?

149
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,400
EHH?!

150
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:29,200
They told me to look towards the ocean so I did as I was told

151
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,600
There was a camera there

152
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,860
So you're saying that it's the camera's fault for being there?

153
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:34,000
That's right~

154
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:37,000
The next situation is this

155
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:39,820
「 Bidding your long-time pet farewell 」

156
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,640
This is quite difficult right?

157
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,910
Isn't this tough?

158
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:47,970
Saito Chiharu's turn to portray her acting skills

159
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:51,230
Oh they used a real dog

160
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:53,110
Oh the dog is still alive

161
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:54,200
What kind of farewell is this?

162
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:54,800
Hey

163
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:57,950
Don't get angry at me

164
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,020
Oh? She's really ..

165
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,950
Thank you for all you've done

166
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:10,570
Bye bye!

167
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:18,880
This is tear-jerking

168
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,600
Next up, Itou Marika would challenge this scene!

169
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:35,130
Tomorrow I'll not be here anymore

170
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:38,040
That's why Momo you must

171
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:44,680
You will be adopted by a relative of mine

172
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,840
No, anything but this!

173
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,150
Ahhh~

174
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:56,510
These boots are expensive!

175
00:07:56,770 --> 00:07:58,350
You were troubled by it

176
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:01,240
This has got to be a joke!

177
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,420
Unexpectedly, she retires halfway through!

178
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:07,970
Next up is Hashimoto Nanami, what kind of acting would she show us?

179
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:09,680
You've worked hard

180
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,730
It's good that you were energetic till the end

181
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:18,340
Byebye! (Laughs)

182
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:20,260
Didn't she just laughed?

183
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:27,930
Oh! What's wrong?

184
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,370
Wait wait! Don't do that!

185
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:36,370
Okay I get it! I'll stay longer with you

186
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,820
UWAHHHH!

187
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:40,260
It's the dog's fault right?

188
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:42,810
Bite her shoes again!

189
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:43,840
Bite them!

190
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:45,260
He's going to bite her shoes!

191
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,860
Sorry! Byebye! .. Byebye!

192
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:50,020
He keeps trying to bite her shoes

193
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,080
Escaped?

194
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,800
She escaped from the dog!

195
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,400
She covered her face!

196
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,480
That concludes this scene

197
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:02,310
She covered her face at the end right?

198
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:03,910
You were totally running away from the dog right?

199
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:07,020
I thought I shouldn't cry

200
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:08,170
You were thinking something like "If it wasn't for this dog" right?

201
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:12,350
This dog is a little bit weird and different from other dogs right?

202
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:14,530
This dog is on a godly level!

203
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:18,130
But .. Itou you wasted your chance

204
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,370
Itou-chan

205
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:22,660
If the dog keeps biting your shoes

206
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:25,060
It means that she should have acted as if she didn't want to leave the dog's side!

207
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:26,710
As an acting skill right?

208
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:31,600
I came with my favorite boots

209
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,110
And then it suddenly bit my boots .. I really wanted it to stop that!

210
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:35,950
Acting < Boots

211
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,820
So her boots are more important

212
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:39,510
That's right, boots are more important right?

213
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,900
Let's move on to the next situation, here it is!

214
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:46,570
「 A battle between female gang leaders 」
A fated confrontation

215
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:48,040
This seems feasible!

216
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,770
It's a school thing right?

217
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:51,240
Such things happens at school too

218
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:51,950
That's true

219
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:56,530
Let the battle between the female gang leaders start!

220
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:57,700
Ehh~

221
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:58,370
Scary!

222
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:00,450
I've got something to say to you

223
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:01,220
Ah, this is good

224
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:04,460
Sometime ago, I saw you and Yuki walking together

225
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:07,040
It does not have anything to do with you!

226
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:09,280
I saw you and him walking out of the park

227
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:11,620
Stop your griping!

228
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:12,110
What?!

229
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:14,680
You're so tiny I can't see you at all!!

230
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,330
Yuki is mine!!

231
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:18,370
What are you saying? He's mine!

232
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:21,170
Yuki has no feelings for you!

233
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:23,000
I love Yuki more than you do!

234
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,150
Are they deciding on who gets Yuki?

235
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:26,970
What the hell are you saying? I'm the one who loves Yuki the most

236
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:27,770
She's right!

237
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:31,970
Next, Takayama VS Ikoma
Keep watching for an epic moment between Takayama and Ikoma!

238
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:34,510
Sakurai Reka

239
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:36,020
Ohh! Things are getting heated up!

240
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:38,000
What the hell do ya want?

241
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,200
Don't go running your mouth about me!

242
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,310
Her being cool is good

243
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:45,000
What's with you?

244
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,970
Which prefecture are ya from?

245
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,020
Ya might not know where this is but I'll say it anyway

246
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:52,200
I'm from Chiba

247
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:54,880
What the hell was that?

248
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:57,040
By the way, I'm from Akita

249
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:02,570
Next up, 13 year old Higuchi corners Hashimoto!

250
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:07,680
I'm Hashimoto from Nogizaka High School B Class

251
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:09,800
Let's settle this after school

252
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,110
Oh! This is good

253
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,710
Fine, you're on!

254
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:17,080
Why did you come to our school for?

255
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:17,370
This is good

256
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:19,200
I can only see you as a mushroom due to your hairstyle

257
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,310
I can only see you as a japanese doll

258
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,150
You're praising her

259
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,420
I came here before you did

260
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:28,110
You've been @#$%^&

261
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,110
Say it!

262
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:30,110
What are you saying?

263
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,970
I see, I get the idea behind this

264
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:36,600
At the last part because she pushed your buttons resulting in you jumbling up your words

265
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:40,110
Unexpectedly you all had destructive power in your words

266
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:41,570
That's scary!
Isn't that good?

267
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:44,600
Matsumura your delinquent acting was a surprise to me

268
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,510
Because your outer appearance looks like you're in a daze

269
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:49,130
You can actually act like a delinquent

270
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:50,370
I tried my best

271
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:52,510
It was like we were fighting for Yuki

272
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:54,950
Oh so the Yuki you all were fighting over was me?

273
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:57,660
Thank you, that made me happy

274
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:02,500
But at the end, I actually kind of moved towards Osamu (Shitara)

275
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,660
Eh? Did you say that?

276
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:04,730
Ahh I didn't say that

277
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:05,750
Then I wouldn't know about it!

278
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:08,040
I'm sorry!

279
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,510
Eto you were good too

280
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:10,950
Is that true?

281
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:12,420
Her glare was scary right?

282
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:15,800
Perhaps there's a real delinquent among you?

283
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,280
The thought of that slightly worries me

284
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:21,950
What was the exchange of hometown between Takayama and Ikoma about?

285
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:23,640
Because we came from rural prefectures

286
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:27,240
It was better to use our local dialect

287
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,400
So we decided to say where were our hometowns

288
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,640
Yes .. Thats ri .. Yes ..

289
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,060
So that's it?

290
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:32,260
Yes that's what went on

291
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:33,460
What's with your stammering

292
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:35,240
She said everything that you wanted to say?

293
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:36,860
That's true

294
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,500
Here is the next situation

295
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
「 Conveying your farewell over the phone while crying 」

296
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,300
TEARS!!

297
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,510
Are there going to be tears?

298
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:45,460
Cry acting is impossible

299
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:46,740
You never know, there might be a star among them!

300
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:47,730
If you cry you're a star!

301
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,370
First up, Nakada Kana challenges the crying scene

302
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:52,710
It would be impossible for Kana

303
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:55,020
He hung up ..

304
00:12:55,020 --> 00:13:00,840
Uwaa .. this seems good

305
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:03,280
This is good!
Right?

306
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,200
5mins passed

307
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:05,730
Eh?

308
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:07,820
Ah, she's waiting

309
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:09,460
Are the tears coming?

310
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:10,600
20mins passed

311
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,570
20mins have passed!

312
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:15,080
Ahh, but the tears seem to be coming soon

313
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:16,910
Her eyes seem to be teary

314
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:17,570
There is there is

315
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:18,860
The result after 20mins

316
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,640
Some tears fill her eyes

317
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:25,660
Next, Itou Nene challenges the crying scene!

318
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:29,520
Hello?

319
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,530
Ahh, he hung up on her

320
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,260
Uohh? Ehh?!

321
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:44,970
Woahh Ehhh!

322
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:48,000
Woah awesome .. AWESOMEE!!

323
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:49,020
This was immediate right?

324
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:50,260
She cried immediately!

325
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,150
That's awesome!

326
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:57,020
Next up, Sakurai challenges this scene

327
00:13:57,020 --> 00:14:01,420
Sakurai

328
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:03,640
Sakurai quickly shifts into the mood

329
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:11,600
This is good

330
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,440
She's crouched up

331
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,680
This is awesome

332
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,820
Cut!

333
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:16,930
I'm sorry

334
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:17,630
Oh she didn't cry

335
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:18,270
(Staff) You didn't cry?

336
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:18,800
EHHHH?! She didn't cry?!

337
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,570
I didnt cry!

338
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:21,550
But isn't this awesome instead? She had us fooled

339
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:23,460
Unexpectedly an awesome fake acting

340
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,480
Sakurai at the ending you weren't crying?

341
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,330
I thought you cried

342
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:29,770
I couldn't seem to cry

343
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:29,780
Umm .. while I was waiting for my turn, I was practicing with all I've got

344
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:31,020
You couldn't seem to cry right?

345
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:36,130
I felt the feeling that the tears were coming out

346
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:38,920
And the tears seemed to accumulate in my eyes

347
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,240
But the mucus from my nose kept flowing out

348
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,110
But if you ignored that wouldn't the tears flow?

349
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,400
The moment I entered that room

350
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:48,570
My tears just seemed to disappear into thin air

351
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:50,750
Oh they were "reset-ed"

352
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,100
Himura, you previously sticked a finger into your throat

353
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:54,510
Yes I did

354
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:56,580
You did that and said "Let's starts!"

355
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:01,840
Because I kept doing that to get the vomiting feeling to force tears out, now I can just feel that feeling even without doing that

356
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:04,350
I'm the worst actor

357
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:07,280
Itou Nene

358
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:08,950
You're good! The tears came fast

359
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:10,900
Thank you

360
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:11,620
That's awesome

361
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:13,350
Yeah, you cried instantly

362
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,460
Yes I did

363
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:15,750
What did you thought about to cry?

364
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:19,130
When I thought about the situation where I return to my home in Gifu

365
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:24,150
Where my family welcome me back at the doorstep just made my tears start flowing

366
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:26,040
Oh so it's tears of joy!

367
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:29,110
If you make yourself feel certain feelings and thoughts you would be able to cry quickly right?

368
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:29,730
That's right

369
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:31,330
That's awesome right?

370
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:32,130
She's a genius

371
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:33,510
She's an actress!

372
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:34,650
She's an actress

373
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:36,480
Nakada you took 20mins ..

374
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,240
I'm sorry

375
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:39,280
No no, it's okay, you managed to cry at the end right?

376
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,200
I did cry but it didn't seem that obvious right?

377
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,060
No, I could tell that your left eye was teary

378
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:46,130
Whoever could shed tears within 30secs is an actress

379
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:47,020
That's true

380
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:49,000
Isn't the amount of pressure immense?

381
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,530
If the camera constantly films you for 20mins straight, your tears would instead not flow

382
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:54,460
That's true

383
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:59,680
「 From a northern country 」 First Love Jun-kun couldn't cry while hearing Ozaki's song, couldn't shed tears at that time too

384
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:04,460
The staff kept waiting patiently for him, Jun-kun was so touched by the staff's patience

385
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:08,730
That he cried and his tears wouldn't stop flowing, those tears are the same as hers

386
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:10,280
Oh .. because they waited so patiently for him

387
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,220
Let's move on, the next situation is this

388
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:16,330
「 A confession to your senpai whom for 3 years you had a one-sided emotions towards 」

389
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:18,060
This is good~

390
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:18,550
This will be good!

391
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:22,280
First up, Ikuta confesses her one-sided emotions towards her senpai

392
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:28,800
Cute~

393
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,550
What she did just now was good

394
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:31,440
Senpai!

395
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,170
Sorry for making you wait!

396
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:34,420
What did you want to talk to me about?

397
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:36,020
Umm ..

398
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,510
I wanted to talk to you about something ..

399
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:43,040
I've always ..

400
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,640
Liked you!

401
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,680
Cute~!

402
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,370
If you would like, please go out with me!

403
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:51,930
Ohh, cute~

404
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:54,040
I'm sorry

405
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,510
Why did he reject her?

406
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:57,680
I already have a girlfriend

407
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:01,020
Ahhhh!

408
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,640
Ahh, so that's it ..

409
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,820
Please don't bother yourself over this ..

410
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:06,970
Oh, she's good

411
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:10,800
Next up is 13 year old Kawago's acting

412
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,570
Senpai!

413
00:17:13,570 --> 00:17:15,620
What was it that you want to tell me?

414
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:16,910
Sorry for taking up your time

415
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,800
Umm .. since some time ago

416
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:22,640
Ever since you transferred here, I've had a crush on you

417
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,570
If you would like, please go out with me

418
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:28,150
Cute~

419
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:28,680
Sorry

420
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,020
Ahh

421
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:32,020
Right now, I already have a girlfriend

422
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,800
I see .. mmm

423
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:39,800
Ahh .. sorry about that

424
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,240
She moved back

425
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:43,570
Ahh, poor thing!

426
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:44,460
I see

427
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,710
She's moving back!

428
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:48,130
THAT'S SUPER SCARY!!

429
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:50,310
SOMEHOW THAT'S SUPER SCARY!!

430
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:54,970
Next up is Takayama, will her confession be successful?

431
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:55,970
Oh! Takayama

432
00:17:55,970 --> 00:17:57,620
Kazumin

433
00:17:58,060 --> 00:17:59,080
She seems natural

434
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,060
Mmm ..

435
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:03,880
Senpai!

436
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:08,860
We've always walked home as friends but

437
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:13,620
From today onwards, please let me walk beside you as your girlfriend

438
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:16,020
This is good

439
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:16,930
Yeah it's okay with me

440
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:20,800
Eh? He said okay?
She got accepted? Oh so there's an 'okay' pattern too

441
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:23,200
Oh this is good

442
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,200
Good
That's cute!

443
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,200
Cute~!

444
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,840
Somehow it made me go kyun

445
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:29,750
They were real good

446
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,480
I want such a drama to be made

447
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,150
For this scene there's the rejected version and the okay version

448
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:37,770
The okay version seems so good right?

449
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:39,280
Takayama you got the okay version right?

450
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:39,800
Yes! Thank you

451
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,570
Takayama you were good
Your acting was cute

452
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:42,860
Thank you very much

453
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:44,180
It was good and natural

454
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:46,110
Thank you, thank you
She was quite natural

455
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:49,770
Her happiness when she got accepted showed at the end

456
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:50,770
Hehe, I was happy

457
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:52,150
You were happy (LOL!)

458
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:53,260
Ah! You were genuinely happy?

459
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:55,100
Ah, it's like umm ..

460
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:57,260
He told me okay in a nonchalant way

461
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:58,080
Ah yes he did

462
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,230
The way he said that in a nonchalant way was very cool!

463
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:02,300
Ahh, you went kyun from that too?

464
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:04,180
I want someone to say that to me too

465
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:06,880
Like in a cold manner

466
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,640
That's it!

467
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:09,670
That's good?

468
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:11,250
Yes, I want to be told that!

469
00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:14,730
You all would want to act in a drama like this right?

470
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:16,730
With the contents of the drama all being confessions

471
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,260
Ah I get what you're saying

472
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:20,930
Everyone take their turns to confess their love

473
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:22,850
And make sure the guy's face isn't filmed at all right?

474
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,160
So that the one watching would think that the members are confessing to him or her right?

475
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:27,120
Yes that's it! I want to do that!

476
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:29,290
I want to be acting as the male role since the guy wouldn't be filmed

477
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:31,320
Yes that's it, as long as the person playing the male lead isn't filmed

478
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:32,570
I want to play the guy's role

479
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:33,600
Well then, Himura

480
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:38,760
Since we're at it, Himura you will play the guy's role

481
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,980
Oh! That's good!

482
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:41,260
I super want to play that role!

483
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:43,780
Then shall we get someone who hasn't acted in that scene?

484
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:44,760
Well then, Ichiki

485
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:45,800
Ichiki you play the female lead

486
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:48,220
Gambatte! Go for it!

487
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:53,860
With that said, Ichiki would confess her love for Himura senpai when he is on the way home

488
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,840
Okay and ready!

489
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,300
ACTION!

490
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:03,210
Right after this, the confession time which makes the members super excited!

491
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:40,840
Ichiki confessing her love to Himura when he is on his way home, what sort of acting would we see?

492
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:42,880
Okay and ready!

493
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:46,460
ACTION!

494
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:50,730
Oi Fujiwara! Shut up!

495
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:54,160
Stupid! Shut up I tell you

496
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:57,800
Shut up stupid!

497
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:02,060
Ahh I'm tired, think I shall get some katsudon before heading home

498
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:03,400
Himura senpai!

499
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,960
Oh! What is it Ichiki?

500
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:09,130
Umm .. today I have something to say to you

501
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:12,860
Oh, I'm hungry so could you make it quick?

502
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:16,200
I've liked you since a long time ago!

503
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,930
If you would like, please go out with me!

504
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:21,400
Sure, no problem at all!

505
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:25,260
I'm very happy! Thank you very much!

506
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:26,860
FINISH!

507
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:28,860
Okay that's a wrap!

508
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:29,930
Ichiki you were good

509
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:31,260
Yes you were good

510
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:32,860
She was cute right?
Yes

511
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:33,820
Her acting was good

512
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,780
That acting scene felt like it was from a novel

513
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:41,060
What about my acting?

514
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:45,220
You didn't do a proper "catchball rally" to properly receive the feelings she tried to convey to you!

515
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:45,900
Catchball?

516
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:48,000
Because you just nonchalantly said "Okay okay whatever"

517
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,320
Please accept her feelings properly this time

518
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,240
Okay I understand

519
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,120
I'll leave the reason to you

520
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:52,600
Okay I've got it

521
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,760
Next up, Hatanaka confesses her love to Himura senpai

522
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,340
Okay and ready!

523
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:00,860
ACTION!

524
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:04,380
Bye then!

525
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:06,500
Thank you!

526
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:10,020
Thank you~!

527
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:11,900
What was that thank you for?

528
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:12,920
Ahh ..

529
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,360
Umm .. I've something to tell you

530
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:22,500
What is it about?

531
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,860
Senpai, I've always liked you

532
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,480
Please allow me to be your girlfriend!

533
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:31,220
Sorry!

534
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:36,500
I'm happy that you said that but I .. 「@#$%^&*」

535
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:40,780
What is the shocking thing that Himura said to Hatanaka!?

536
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,400
Senpai, I've always liked you

537
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,840
Please allow me to be your girlfriend!

538
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:50,540
Sorry!

539
00:22:52,140 --> 00:23:00,540
I'm happy but, once I've graduated I'm going somewhere far away

540
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:01,320
I'm going somewhere far away!

541
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,320
Despite that, it's still fine with me

542
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,680
If you say that ..

543
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:09,220
I would have to bring you along with me far away

544
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:13,940
Even with that, is it still fine with you?

545
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:15,020
Bring me along with you~

546
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:16,680
BRING YOU ALONG?!

547
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,360
Okay then!

548
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,400
From today, you're my girl!

549
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,320
FINISH!

550
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:26,260
You were good!

551
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:29,020
Your acting was good

552
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,360
Someone told me this before

553
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:34,280
I was told that "For people who have dissatisfactions about this world .."

554
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:37,400
I was told that it's good to have dissatisfactions about this world

555
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:41,280
People who are less straightforward tend to act better

556
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:46,780
Just them sitting back in that posture, is already good, that's what I've heard

557
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:50,780
Somehow .. I'm not badmouthing you but, you seem to have dissatisfactions about this world

558
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:53,320
You just joined (Nogizaka) right?

559
00:23:54,260 --> 00:24:01,660
