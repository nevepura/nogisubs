00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:15,110
<font size="32">DON! Nogizakatte Doko? has started, we're your hosts Bananaman</font>

2
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:18,510
<font size="32">And, and these are the Nogizaka-chans</font>

3
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,450
<font size="32">1, 2... Do you like ski?
 [Pun with "ski" and "suki"]</font>

4
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:29,280
<font size="32">So, Himura, tell us what we're doing today</font>

5
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,850
<font size="32">- Eh, say it coldly
- Coldly?</font>

6
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:40,880
<font size="32">Nogizaka Ski Camp!</font>

7
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:47,710
<font size="32">These two have said in the show...</font>

8
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:50,250
<font size="32">- I'm really strong in the snow
- It's true, it's true</font>

9
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:51,680
<font size="32">Weren't you two bad at sports?</font>

10
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,380
<font size="32">No, we're really strong in the snow</font>

11
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:55,780
<font size="32">You can ski?</font>

12
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:56,710
<font size="32">We can!</font>

13
00:00:57,610 --> 00:00:59,480
<font size="32">With that said...</font>

14
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:06,810
<font size="32">Akimoto & Ikoma Presents: Nogizaka Ski Camp!</font>

15
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:08,880
<font size="32">The snow!</font>

16
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:15,850
<font size="32">This time it's us, the bottom two athletes in Nogizaka, but</font>

17
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:20,650
<font size="32">when we said we were good in the snow, everyone came along! Yay!</font>

18
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:22,880
<font size="32">We can only ski!</font>

19
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,250
<font size="32">Yes, only skiing</font>

20
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:28,850
<font size="32">This time we're at the Maiko Snow Resort, Niigata prefecture</font>

21
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:31,410
<font size="32">with collaboration of Maiko Hotels</font>

22
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:34,980
<font size="32">The members, divided into team Akimoto and team Ikoma, are having a ski classroom</font>

23
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:39,710
<font size="32">Ultimately, to evaluate each team's progression, we're having them compete in a race</font>

24
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:44,950
<font size="32">First it's team Akimoto</font>

25
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:48,910
<font size="32">To be honest, I haven't had a single ski experience</font>

26
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:50,480
<font size="32">- She hadn't? That's bad</font>

27
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:55,680
<font size="32">I used to go skiing with my family in Hokkaido, but</font>

28
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,450
<font size="32">I got scared once and haven't done it since</font>

29
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:03,950
<font size="32">I'm inexperienced along with Maimai! I'll do my best!</font>

30
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:10,680
<font size="32">I'm Iori Sagara. I've already skiied twice. I'll do my best</font>

31
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,810
<font size="32">For me it's the 9th time</font>

32
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:14,280
<font size="32">Wow! Cool</font>

33
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,910
<font size="32">- It's cool so please call me for help today
- It's unexpected!</font>

34
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:20,750
<font size="32">And for team Ikoma's members...</font>

35
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:24,410
<font size="32">I went skiing only once</font>

36
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:27,850
<font size="32">but I fell and got scared</font>

37
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:30,180
<font size="32">so I changed to the sleigh immediately</font>

38
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:34,110
<font size="32">I went skiing in a school trip</font>

39
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:36,450
<font size="32">only once, but</font>

40
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:37,980
<font size="32">How many years ago?</font>

41
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,980
<font size="32">- Uh...
- Eh, even if you ask me...</font>

42
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:43,780
<font size="32">I don't have any ski experience! I'll do my best</font>

43
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:50,750
<font size="32">I don't have any ski experience as well! I'll be in your care</font>

44
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:55,880
<font size="32">This ski camp is almost full of inexperienced girls</font>

45
00:02:55,880 --> 00:03:00,110
<font size="32">First, we'll show each team's teacher's skills</font>

46
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:06,550
<font size="32">What kind of sliding will these two bad athletes show?</font>

47
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:07,650
<font size="32">You wouldn't think those two would be good at skiing!</font>

48
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:10,680
<font size="32">Teacher Akimoto, good luck!</font>

49
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,710
<font size="32">I'm going!</font>

50
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,310
<font size="32">Manattan, where is your zukkyun?</font>

51
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:25,350
<font size="32">To everyone's hearts, zukkyun!</font>

52
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:41,350
<font size="32">Yes, I can slide</font>

53
00:03:41,950 --> 00:04:02,080
<font size="32">Teacher Ikoma, good luck!</font>

54
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,150
<font size="32">I can only ski</font>

55
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:07,650
<font size="32">Then, let's start the ski class</font>

56
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:11,780
<font size="32">I'd like to start by putting the ski boards</font>

57
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,710
<font size="32">Do you know how to do it?</font>

58
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:15,380
<font size="32">I don't know</font>

59
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:18,950
<font size="32">- They're heavier than they look
- Heavy!</font>

60
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:22,680
<font size="32">If you aren't careful, you can cut your finger in this part</font>

61
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,180
<font size="32">Where?</font>

62
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,480
<font size="32">Is there a left and right board?</font>

63
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,280
<font size="32">There isn't left and right</font>

64
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:33,680
<font size="32">I think there's some snow left</font>

65
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,680
<font size="32">Hit it with the stock</font>

66
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,180
<font size="32">- Is this called stock?
- Yes, it is</font>

67
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:44,110
<font size="32">If you start by your toes it's easier to put it on</font>

68
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:47,210
<font size="32">Did everyone manage to separate the boards?</font>

69
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:50,680
<font size="32">I can't</font>

70
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:57,610
<font size="32">- Huh, it's hard to pull off
- Teacher!</font>

71
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:00,650
<font size="32">Even though you have been doing it for 9 years</font>

72
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:07,050
<font size="32">We need a real teacher...</font>

73
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:08,880
<font size="32">They realized I'm not a real teacher</font>

74
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:12,380
<font size="32">If you slide this up, you'll be able to separate them</font>

75
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:14,380
<font size="32">You slide them up</font>

76
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:15,850
<font size="32">I've been doing it backwards until now</font>

77
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:18,280
<font size="32">Thank you</font>

78
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:22,250
<font size="32">Now, with advice of a real teacher,</font>

79
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:26,510
<font size="32">they're learning the very basics: how to fall and stop</font>

80
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:29,010
<font size="32">by practicing in small slopes</font>

81
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:36,950
<font size="32">Noujo, yabai! Once more, once more</font>

82
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:38,750
<font size="32">Am I going fine?</font>

83
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:41,210
<font size="32">1, 2... Yes, slide</font>

84
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:42,180
<font size="32">Break!</font>

85
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:47,950
<font size="32">My legs are supposed to open this much?</font>

86
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:01,110
<font size="32">Stop, I'm scared</font>

87
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:03,250
<font size="32">Well, if it was with Nogizaka, I'd like to go skiing</font>

88
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:06,080
<font size="32">Why?</font>

89
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:11,180
<font size="32">But now, until they get the hang of it, they've got to practice by repeating it</font>

90
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:14,580
<font size="32">Let's start going by lift to the main course</font>

91
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:20,350
<font size="32">In team Akimoto, where everyone is advancing at the same pace...</font>

92
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:24,480
<font size="32">Miona is a bit...</font>

93
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:28,580
<font size="32">Hori of the Ikoma team is facing her own struggle</font>

94
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:31,850
<font size="32">My legs are dying...</font>

95
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:34,510
<font size="32">My body is really stiff...</font>

96
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:42,150
<font size="32">But the rest of the Spartan team Ikoma is already advancing in a fast pace</font>

97
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:43,380
<font size="32">When...</font>

98
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:46,710
<font size="32">Miona, why are you by yourself?</font>

99
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:50,280
<font size="32">Um, I got left behind because of my speed...</font>

100
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:53,880
<font size="32">Only now I've been able to stand on top of the snow</font>

101
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,210
<font size="32">Aren't you already pretty late?</font>

102
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:59,350
<font size="32">The upper half of your body is falling</font>

103
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:02,850
<font size="32">Everyone's telling me that</font>

104
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:06,450
<font size="32">Overcoming the humiliation of being made fun of by Akimoto...</font>

105
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:09,210
<font size="32">Will Hori be able to improve?</font>

106
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:16,580
<font size="32">After this, members of both teams are somehow acquiring the basics</font>

107
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,650
<font size="32">Will team Akimoto win with its teamwork</font>

108
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:24,280
<font size="32">or will it be team Ikoma and its Spartan practice?</font>

109
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:28,750
<font size="32">The pride of the two bad athletes is at bet in this showdown!</font>

110
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:31,710
<font size="32">Continues in the next half!</font>

111
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:35,150
<font size="32">But really, you two are really good!</font>

112
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:36,110
<font size="32">Yes, we are</font>

113
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:38,780
<font size="32">On top of the snow, my blood starts boiling</font>

114
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:42,250
<font size="32">It really is easier when you have something stuck to your legs</font>

115
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:49,980
<font size="32">But it's difficult! I wonder how you can do it so much better than the other sports</font>

116
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:51,280
<font size="32">Because we like it</font>

117
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,650
<font size="32">Here it is! "Suki" and "ski"</font>

118
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:55,010
<font size="32">[A cheap pun.]</font>

119
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:57,780
<font size="32">Among other members, there were many inexperienced people</font>

120
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:02,580
<font size="32">Noujo... Did you choose your own clothes?</font>

121
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:03,750
<font size="32">I did</font>

122
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,010
<font size="32">Eh... Funassyi</font>

123
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:09,550
<font size="32">It's true, it does look a bit like Funassyi</font>

124
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:18,480
<font size="32">Nogizaka karaoke competition!</font>

125
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,980
<font size="32">Some old guys showed up!</font>

126
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:25,110
<font size="32">From now on, we're having both teams compete in various things</font>

127
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:28,980
<font size="32">and this will add to the ski challenge to decide the winner</font>

128
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:34,010
<font size="32">By the way, it's Biking who will host the challenges</font>

129
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:39,610
<font size="32">Representatives of both teams will face each other at karaoke</font>

130
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:43,550
<font size="32">The team with the highest score wins!</font>

131
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:47,350
<font size="32">It's not like you guys are singers, you are idols</font>

132
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:51,080
<font size="32">That is your main work</font>

133
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,880
<font size="32">This will measure your improvement</font>

134
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,280
<font size="32">Do you usually go to karaoke?</font>

135
00:08:57,710 --> 00:08:59,280
<font size="32">Why are you singing!?</font>

136
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,280
<font size="32">I don't want you to sing!</font>

137
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:06,580
<font size="32">The first battle is Noujo of team Ikoma versus Wada of team Akimoto</font>

138
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:09,650
<font size="32">I frequently go to karaoke with other members</font>

139
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:12,350
<font size="32">I like old songs</font>

140
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:15,110
<font size="32">I only sing Showa era songs</font>

141
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:19,080
<font size="32">First is Noujo from team Ikoma</font>

142
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,150
<font size="32">What in the world is she going to sing?</font>

261
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:54,880
<font size="32">But now, there is a shocking revelation</font>

262
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,250
<font size="32">It isn't spicy</font>

263
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:57,480

<font size="32">Really?</font>

266
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:07,250
<font size="32">What about that lag?</font>

267
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:10,210
<font size="32">What made you think that?</font>

268
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:12,150
<font size="32">I'm absolutely fine with spicy food</font>

269
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:15,510
<font size="32">When I ate it, I felt some crunchiness</font>

270
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:24,050
<font size="32">Wait, you can't eat this without reacting</font>

271
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:26,080
<font size="32">I can't feel spiciness</font>

272
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,580
<font size="32">Then you are a disgrace to this game!</font>

273
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:39,510
<font size="32">After Matsui's special power revelation, with 3 spicy takoyakis, team Akimoto has turned the tables</font>

<font size="32">How are their karaoke skills?</font>

276
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:47,950
<font size="32">I'm great at skiing but terrible at singing</font>

277
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:49,480
<font size="32">That's not true</font>

278

<font size="32">When I hear myself singing in the TV, I hate my voice so much I cover my ears</font>

279
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,650
<font size="32">Stop doing that!</font>

280
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:02,910
<font size="32">Recently, I've not been able to go to karaoke but I've been humming nicely at home</font>

00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:08,280
<font size="32">In the shower, my level has been increasing</font>

282
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,110
<font size="32">Your humming level has increased?</font>

283
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:12,850
<font size="32">It's quite up</font>

284
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:14,780
<font size="32">and I think I'm pretty prepared</font>

285
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:20,950
<font size="32">The song chosen by leader Ikoma is...</font>

00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:39,510
<font size="32">It's been 2 years since that shocking singing. What kind of improvement has she got?</font>

334
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:12,510

00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:18,850
<font size="32">While I was singing, I thought it was good, but after it, they called my manager</font>

337
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:22,480
<font size="32">Yes, that was when I noticed</font>

353
00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:56,450
<font size="32">I didn't really think I was a bad singer before entering Nogizaka</font>

<font size="32">but after everyone started telling me that</font>

355

00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:19,280
<font size="32">It's not like that</font>

361
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:24,710
<font size="32">Is this right?</font>

362
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:25,380
<font size="32">Do it from "aka"</font>

363
00:23:26,810 --> 00:23:28,050
<font size="32">"Aka" is already wrong</font>

364
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:37,150
<font size="32">Wrong!</font>
