00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:05,740
<font size="38">An unexpected development for Nogizaka46 during the new year.</font>

2
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:13,700
<font size="38">Last week we announced the 16 senbatsu members for their CD debut single, available on 22nd February.</font>

3
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:21,520
<font size="38">For tonight the senbatsu members will be performing their songs in the studio for the first time.</font>

4
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,460
<font size="38">And the song they're going to perform is?</font>

5
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:29,440
<font size="38">Also, Bananaman and the new senbatsu members will have a face-to-face interview too!</font>

6
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:35,000
<font size="38">Members' unexpected true form and charismatic side are going to be revealed!</font>

7
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:40,740
<font size="38">Nogizakatte, Doko?</font>

8
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:56,060
<font size="60">Subs: NeruestSub</font>

9
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:57,200
<font size="38">DON!</font>

10
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,040
<font size="38">Nogizakatte, Doko?</font>

11
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,640
<font size="38">We're the MC Bananaman, yoroshiku onegaishimasu.</font>

12
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:06,680
<font size="38">And here's the Nogizaka46 members for today.</font>

13
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:09,620
<font size="38">Yoroshiku onegaishimasu!</font>

14
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:18,120
<font size="38">So starting from today the new senbatsu members seat positions will be different right?</font>

15
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:23,660
<font size="38">So let's introduce our guest for tonight...</font>

16
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:23,660
<font size="38">-BAKARHYTHM. -Hello, yoroshiku onegaishimasu.</font>

17
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:28,440
<font face="Times New Roman" size="32">{\an8}Masuno Hidetomo(升野英知). Actor and comedian. Stage name Bakarhythm(バカリズム).</font>

18
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:28,480
<font size="38">Masuno-san you're currently doing a show called Idoling!!! right?</font>

19
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:31,620
<font face="Times New Roman" size="32">{\an8}Idoling!!! (アイドリング!!!) is a Japanese TV show with attached female idol group created by Fuji TV.</font>

20
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:33,600
<font size="38">-That's right, for a long time. -How many years?</font>

21
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,020
<font size="38">More or less 6 years?</font>

22
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:38,340
<font size="38">Obviously the girls over here are more kawai.</font>

23
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,240
<font size="38">They won without a doubt!</font>

24
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:45,820
<font size="38">So what's our plan for this week?</font>

25
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:49,240
<font size="38">-Himura-san, onegaishimasu. -Got it.</font>

26
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:52,160
<font size="38">To know more about the new members</font>

27
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:55,940
<font size="38">Bananaman face-to-face interview!!!</font>

28
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:03,280
<font size="38">We gave the new 16 senbatsu members some questionnaire.</font>

29
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:07,640
<font size="38">From there we will select 5 members' answers so we get to know more about them. </font>

30
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:12,480
<font size="38">First up, Saito Asuka who just entered the senbatsu for the first time.</font>

31
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,260
<font size="38">-The youngest, right? -Yes.</font>

32
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,920
<font size="38">-13 years old? -13 years old.</font>

33
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,200
<font size="38">Your mom is from Myanmar(Burma)?</font>

34
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,080
<font size="38">So you're <s>Taylor Swift</s> mixed race? -Yes.</font>

35
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,340
<font size="38">So do you know any other language than Japanese?</font>

36
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:29,580
<font size="38">My mom can speak it but basically, I don't know how to speak it.</font>

37
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:32,980
<font size="38">How about some easy words? Do you know any Burmese words?</font>

38
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:32,980
<font size="38">Thank you in Burmese is "cè-zù tin-ba-deh."</font>

39
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:37,320
<font face="Times New Roman" size="32">{\an8}ေက်းဇူးတန္ပါတယ္။.  "Thank you" in Burmese.</font>

40
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,660
<font size="38">cè-zù tin-ba-deh. It's easy to memorize.</font>

41
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:42,400
<font size="38">The reason you joined Nogizaka46</font>

42
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,000
<font size="38">was because you wanted to change your silent and the wicked personality.</font>

43
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,120
<font size="38">-Do you not like to talk? -It's not like I hate to talk, it's more like I'm wicked.</font>

44
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:50,180
<font size="38">Kurokatta* huh?</font>

45
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:52,220
<font face="Times New Roman" size="32">{\an8}Kurokatta(黒かった) usually means either the person is despicable, wicked or evil-minded, but not always.</font>

46
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:54,920
<font size="38">Eh..Why? What's wrong?</font>

47
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:57,300
<font size="38">How wicked are you?</font>

48
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:02,120
<font size="38">Like pouring water into an ant-hole and stomp them, that kind of wicked?</font>

49
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:06,580
<font size="38">I don't interact with my friends in school either.</font>

50
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:10,660
<font size="38">I just kinda daydreaming alone in the corner. </font>

51
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:13,900
<font size="38">-Do you draw circles when you're daydreaming? -No.</font>

52
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:16,180
<font size="38">Well, then you're just like a ghost, no?</font>

53
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:17,700
<font size="38">You knew that yourself, right?</font>

54
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,860
<font size="38">I always hated that side of me.</font>

55
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:24,560
<font size="38">So if there's someone just like me, I wanted to spread the happiness to them too.</font>

56
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,460
<font size="38">-You're only 13 years old and you thought of that already? -That's incredible.</font>

57
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:32,400
<font size="38">So you're happy now, right? You have many good friends here.</font>

58
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:34,320
<font size="38">-That's good. -Yeah.</font>

59
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:37,520
<font size="38">So from your questionnaire's anwer let's see what you wanted the most right now. </font>

60
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:42,520
<font size="38">Although any answers is fine, it doesn't mean we have to give you. </font>

61
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:45,000
<font size="38">The stuff she wanted the most might relate to her age.</font>

62
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,080
<font size="38">But the answer she wrote is totally unexpected.</font>

63
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,520
<font size="38">Cellphone strap.</font>

64
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:53,780
<font size="38">Aint that kinda cute? -Yeah, it's cute.</font>

65
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:57,240
<font size="38">But didn't we usually wanted shoes or dress that kind of stuff?</font>

66
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,500
<font size="38">-I don't really... -You don't want them?</font>

67
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:02,080
<font size="38">So, you're not materialistic?</font>

68
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,780
<font size="38">At the age of 13, didn't we usually asked for a lot of stuff?</font>

69
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:11,680
<font size="38">I really wanted a robot that looks like a female. </font>

70
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:17,140
<font size="38"><s>You need help ASAP</s> Are you really ok?</font>

71
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:22,880
<font size="38">Next up, Noujo Ami who entered the senbatsu for the first time too.</font>

72
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:27,380
<font size="38">Noujo Ami. Your dream, when you're in primary school, is to become an idol.</font>

73
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:30,400
<font size="38">She learned how to sing and dance every day.</font>

74
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,480
<font size="38">So basically, she does not have memories of playing with her friends.</font>

75
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,100
<font size="38">-Really? -Yes.</font>

76
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:39,680
<font size="38">Every week my timetable was filled with lessons and classes only.</font>

77
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:44,740
<font size="38">But I actually enjoyed during that time.</font>

78
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:49,020
<font size="38">So basically I do not have memories of playing with my friends.</font>

79
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:55,160
<font size="38">And after the lessons ended or if there's any holiday, you just want to sleep.</font>

80
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:59,760
<font size="38">If someone asked you to hang out together, you'll just decline them without a doubt.</font>

81
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:02,940
<font size="38">Must be really tired because of all those lessons.</font>

82
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:05,140
<font size="38">But for me, instead of tired</font>

83
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:11,280
<font size="38">you just don't want to hang out with another person because it's too much trouble.</font>

84
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:15,520
<font size="38">If I had to choose between going out or sleeping</font>

85
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,740
<font size="38">I would've chosen to sleep every time.</font>

86
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:22,000
<font size="38">Eh? You don't want to hang out with friends and go shopping or eat crepe together?</font>

87
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
<font size="38">Crepes are really sweet you know?</font>

88
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,280
<font size="38">You probably don't know. -You probably won't know.</font>

89
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,280
<font size="38">There's a salty flavor too.</font>

90
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:32,340
<font size="38">That's why you should've opened your heart more.</font>

91
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:36,200
<font size="38">After all, you just have to open your heart to everyone.</font>

92
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:42,020
<font size="38">You know, this lesson(Social interactions) is going to be harder to master than every other lesson. </font>

93
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:44,540
<font face="Times New Roman" size="32">{\an8}"Human interaction is harder than other lessons." - Master Shitara 2k12</font>

94
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:46,480
<font size="38">Whats up, Master Shitara!</font>

95
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,480
<font size="38">So...that's all from me.</font>

96
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:55,340
<font size="38">-I think I should be allowed to leave after I said that. -Is there any rule like that?</font>

97
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:58,660
<font size="38">There's a info coming from Takayama.</font>

98
00:05:58,660 --> 00:05:59,540
<font size="38">-Takayama -"Annie"?</font>

99
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:00,860
<font face="Times New Roman" size="32">{\an8}Annie. From a broadway stage performance called Little Orphan Annie(1982).</font>

100
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,920
<font size="38">Annie...ummm...</font>

101
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,920
<font size="38">The song "Tomorrow." Yes, that one.</font>

102
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:09,480
<font size="38">She said that she always wanted to perform as "Annie". That's her dream.</font>

103
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:12,760
<font size="38">-So "Ami" wanted to become "Annie". -Yes, that's right. </font>

104
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:18,700
<font size="38">-Ami and Annie sound alike. -Ikuchan and Ami always say that Annie is their goal.</font>

105
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:23,920
<font size="38">That's kinda challenging, right?</font>

106
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,960
<font size="38">-So two of you think of Annie as your goal? -Yes.</font>

107
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:31,460
<font size="38">-We even made it into the final review. -Really!? That's incredible!</font>

108
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:35,800
<font size="38">But Takayama also mentioned "Annie" has already become an ongoing gag for her.</font>

109
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:41,020
<font size="38">Ami has a deep voice but Annie has a higher pitch.</font>

110
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:43,720
<font size="38">So I thought she can't reach the note. I asked her to sing it.</font>

111
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:48,440
<font size="38">And it turned out to be really funny, so it became an ongoing gag for her.</font>

112
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,020
<font size="38">Let show it to everyone.</font>

113
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,000
<font size="38">I'll just sing the child part which I used for the audition.</font>

114
00:06:53,000 --> 00:07:02,240
<font face="Times New Roman" size="32">{\an8}( I had no idea what she's singing, so I'm just gonna quickly go through of what I heard.)</font>

115
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:07,840
<font size="38"><i>"You'd make me like her hair, through my nose..."</i></font>

116
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,840
<font size="38"><i>...together octopus...</i></font>

117
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,600
<font size="38"><i>...Eye to eye.</i></font>

118
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:20,260
<font size="38">-That's kinda nice! -Incredible!</font>

119
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:26,960
<font size="38">This is incredible. It will definately become a strong comedy joke.</font>

120
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:32,660
<font size="38">You should just link Annie and yourself together after this.</font>

121
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,400
<font size="38">Understand Annie?</font>

122
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:38,840
<font size="38"><i>"You'd make me..."</i></font>

123
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:44,140
<font size="38">That's nice! That's nice! Good reaction time! Not bad!</font>

124
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:46,340
<font size="38">-How was it? -That's great!</font>

125
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,340
<font size="38">Please teach me after this!</font>

126
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:53,040
<font size="38">Next up, the one and only adorable Hoshino Minami♥</font>

127
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:57,340
<font size="38">It mentioned that you auditioned for AKB before.</font>

128
00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:00,300
<font size="38">Because a friend told you to do it.</font>

129
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,820
<font size="38">You made it into the second phase.</font>

130
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:07,500
<font size="38">Whatever the other asked you, you would just say "Isn't that normal?"</font>

131
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:13,920
<font size="38">Like "Why do you want to be a lovely idol?" she would say "Isn't that normal?"</font>

132
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,540
<font size="38">So this is like your catchphrase.</font>

133
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:23,380
<font size="38">Do I say that often? -Yes, you do. x6</font>

134
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:27,880
<font size="38">-It seems like it. -You're not that confident, right? "Isn't that normal?"</font>

135
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:32,600
<font size="38">Himura-san has this at the beginning of every sentence.</font>

136
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:36,060
<font size="38">-"What I said might be wrong, ok?" -Yes, yes. That's right.</font>

137
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:42,200
<font size="38">That's because he did not have much confidence.</font>

138
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:48,720
<font size="38">"Might be wrong..." "Isn't that normal?" sound more like a self-comfort.</font>

139
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,140
<font size="38">But you don't have to worry about it.</font>

140
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,140
<font size="38">No talents or strengths?</font>

141
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,800
<font size="38">It wrote, "My talent is that I do not have any."</font>

142
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,420
<font size="38">I don't have any skills that can be a talent. -Sound just like Shitara-san.</font>

143
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:04,820
<font size="38">I think so too. I really don't have any sort of talent.</font>

144
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:09,440
<font size="38">That's why sometimes I said "Collecting mugs is my talent/hobby."</font>

145
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:14,200
<font size="38">Won't they asked, "How many did you collect so far?" -Yes, they will.</font>

146
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:18,080
<font size="38">But I really did collect a lot of mugs.</font>

147
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:21,200
<font size="38">But...there's nothing special about it, right?</font>

148
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,660
<font size="38">It felt unreliable(her talents).</font>

149
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:25,520
<font size="38">Yeah, you guys are totally the same.</font>

150
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:29,600
<font size="38">Maybe she treated herself very strictly, so she thought she was not special at all.</font>

151
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,600
<font size="38">Let's hear it from the everyone else.</font>

152
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,680
<font size="38">Hashimoto, what do you think of Hoshino?</font>

153
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:40,420
<font size="38">I found out about this today. She can eat breads that have the same taste over and over again.</font>

154
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:44,440
<font size="38">Always eat the same flavor's bread...</font>

155
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:48,600
<font size="38">Hoshino, do you really eat the same flavor's bread over and over again?</font>

156
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,200
<font size="38">What flavor?</font>

157
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:50,220
<font size="38">Strawberry Specials*.</font>

158
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,640
<font face="Times New Roman" size="32">{\an8}A popular product from Yamazaki Baking. "Strawberry Specials" is a strawberry cream sandwich cake.</font>

159
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:58,560
<font size="38">Ah! Strawberry Specials is really tasted! I ate that a lot too!</font>

160
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,020
<font size="38">That's tasty. Can she eat that forever?</font>

161
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:04,260
<font size="38">-Always saw her eating that. -Kawai.</font>

162
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:09,940
<font size="38">-Well your "talents" could be the Strawberry Specials. -That's cute!</font>

163
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,900
<font size="38">Everyone...I've heard the news!</font>

164
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:19,520
<font size="38">It seems like you guys were featured in some kind of commercial.</font>

165
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,180
<font size="38">That's really incredible!</font>

166
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,860
<font size="38">Sugoi! That's really incredible!</font>

167
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:30,640
<font size="38">Nogizaka46 first ever CM!</font>

168
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:32,100
<font size="38">They did not expect to be able to participate in a brand that was highly regarded. Meiji's*.</font>

169
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:37,100
<font face="Times New Roman" size="32">{\an8}(A popular Japanese snack food company. They manufacture a wide range of products.)</font>

170
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:41,120
<font size="38">Because this was their first ever commercial deal they felt nervous.</font>

171
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,640
<font size="38">The first member to shoot, Shiraishi Mai.</font>

172
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:48,520
<font size="38">I like Nanamin because she can be interesting and cute at the same time.</font>

173
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:54,220
<font size="38">I'm first again plus this is our first commercial shooting.</font>

174
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:55,780
<font size="38">I was very nervous.</font>

175
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,400
<font size="38">My heart's pounds really hard.</font>

176
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,580
<font size="38">I did not think of any lines to say</font>

177
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:06,720
<font size="38">but I kinda improvised on the spot during the shooting. I was very nervous.</font>

178
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:13,420
<font size="38">Actually, this CM required the members to speak up their own mind while improvising the lines on the spot.</font>

179
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:18,940
<font size="38">From now onwards whether you're my teammate, friends or my sister</font>

180
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:22,320
<font size="38">I want to rely on you Kazumin! Yoroshiku Onegaishimasu!</font>

181
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:37,760
<font size="38">Hearing what Ikoma had just said Takayama started to tear up.</font>

182
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,760
<font size="38">Thank you~</font>

183
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,820
<font size="38">One after another the words that they don't normally say to each other</font>

184
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:50,700
<font size="38">was passed on to them as lines for the commercial.</font>

185
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:53,940
<font size="38">They finished their shooting nicely.</font>

186
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:56,720
<font size="38">We experienced a lot about shooting techniques.</font>

187
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:02,080
<font size="38">It's beyond my imagination that they can create a commercial with this result.</font>

188
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:10,520
<font size="38">Also, they appeared on a big CM press conference on 12th.</font>

189
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:15,760
<font size="38">I'm very happy that we get to spread happiness to everyone.</font>

190
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:20,700
<font size="38">They never had a big crowd presented in front of them so they're a little nervous.</font>

191
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:25,420
<font size="38">Please enjoy the CM topic in the studio after this!</font>

192
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:30,220
<font size="38">The CM was already out on yesterday. Nobody has seen it yet, right?</font>

193
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:32,840
<font size="38">-Not yet. -We haven't seen it yet too.</font>

194
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,840
<font size="38">Well, let's watch it together.</font>

195
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:38,280
<font size="38">-Meiji! -it's Meiji!</font>

196
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,140
<font size="38">Handmade Valentine.</font>

197
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:40,220
<font size="38">Wow, Sugei!!</font>

<font size="38">-May I? -Sure!</font>

200
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:51,840
<font size="38">What did you make?</font>

201
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,940
<font size="38">-That's a secret. -A secret?</font>

202
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,380
<font size="38">-Continue to do your best ok? -Me too!</font>

203
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:58,740
<font size="38">-That's really cute. -You're cute too.</font>

204
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:02,300
<font size="38">I handmade this with my thought for you. </font>

205
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:05,560
<font size="38">If its chocolate that you want, pick Meiji!</font>

206
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:09,360
<font size="38">-Wow! Sugei! -That's Incredible!</font>

207
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:12,500
<font size="38">-Sugoi! It's Meiji's.</font>

208
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:18,380
<font size="38">There was like a faint background music during the commercial.</font>

209
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,000
<font size="38">Could it be...</font>

210
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:28,020
<font size="38">The debut single song that's going to be released on 22nd February? -Yes!</font>

211
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:34,600
<font size="38">It seems like Nogizaka is beginning to show some good results, gradually.</font>

212
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:37,240
<font size="38">-The debut song... -I wanna hear it.</font>

213
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:45,840
<font size="38">There will be an opportunity for them to perform the song on here, right?</font>

214
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:51,360
<font size="38">But the time has not yet arrived. Sorry everyone, but not now.</font>

215
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,500
<font size="38">But as a consolation, they will reveal their debut single's CW song.</font>

216
00:13:55,500 --> 00:14:00,740
<font face="Times New Roman" size="32">{\an8}CW Songs/Coupling song/B-side tracks. Basically refers to the songs that are not the title song(A-side track) of a CD single.</font>

217
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:04,180
<font size="38">-It's finally here. -Sugoi!</font>

218
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:10,040
<font size="38">Let us watch this together, shall we? You won't find it anywhere else.</font>

219
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:15,880
<font size="38">Let's watch the VTR. Dozo!</font>

220
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:23,720
<font size="38">After the commercial break the reveal of the coupling song. The song will be...</font>

221
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:28,420
<font size="38">-Eh!? -What!? This is!</font>

222
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:37,720
<font size="38"><i>Wanted to see you, wanted to see you, Wanted to see you, yes!</i></font>

223
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:42,420
<font size="38"><i>Wanted to see you, wanted to see you, Wanted to see you, yes!</i></font>

224
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:45,520
<font size="38"><i>To you...</i></font>

225
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:53,080
<font size="38"><i>I climbed the hill as I pedaled </i></font>

226
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:57,880
<font size="38"><i>my bike with all my strength,</i></font>

227
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:02,940
<font size="38"><i>Even the shirt inflated by the wind</i></font>

228
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:06,360
<font size="38"><i>is now frustrating.</i></font>

229
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,640
<font size="38"><i>I'll go on honestly,</i></font>

230
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:16,580
<font size="38"><i>with the true feelings I realized at last</i></font>

231
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:32,940
<font size="38"><i>Run on the only road there is!</i></font>

232
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:37,740
<font size="38"><i>If I love you, I'll say so</i></font>

233
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:43,100
<font size="38"><i>I'll be honest without deception</i></font>

234
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:48,120
<font size="38"><i>If I love you, I'll say so</i></font>

235
00:15:48,120 --> 00:16:12,960
<font size="38"><i>I'll disclose the depths of my heart</i></font>

236
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:17,980
<font size="38"><i>Wanted to see you, wanted to see you, Wanted to see you, yes!</i></font>

237
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,700
<font size="38"><i>Wanted to see you, wanted to see you, Wanted to see you, yes!</i></font>

238
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,440
<font size="38"><i>To you...</i></font>

239
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:30,300
<font size="38"><i>Wanted to see you~</i></font>

240
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:38,280
<font size="38">Incredible! I did not expect to hear this song!</font>

241
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:42,840
<font size="38">So this is that song AKB48's "Aitakatta(Wanted to see you)"</font>

242
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:46,500
<font size="38">But the melody is kinda different than AKB48.</font>

243
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,680
<font size="38">What's the song title? Three two...</font>

244
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:51,240
<font size="38">"Aitakatta kamoshirenai (Wanted to see you...maybe.)"</font>

245
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,380
<font face="Times New Roman" size="32">{\an8}Well played Aki-p.</font>

246
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:57,600
<font size="38">What do you mean!? Do it have different lyrics?</font>

247
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,600
<font size="38">It's the same lyrics.</font>

248
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:06,620
<font size="38">This is probably going to change how everyone views the original song.</font>

249
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,520
<font size="38">The song should be popular since it's impressive.</font>

250
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:14,800
<font size="38">We saw how the members had danced during the christmas broadcast.</font>

251
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:18,840
<font size="38">But for the first time, the dance and the songs fit so well together.</font>

252
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:21,060
<font size="38">-Not bad at all. -Sugei.</font>

253
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:26,000
<font size="38">Especially the last part of the performance was really nice.</font>

254
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,240
<font size="38">I too listened to a bunch of Idoling's song.</font>

255
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,640
<font size="38">They had no chance to beat the girls over here.</font>

256
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:35,700
<font size="38">If there's two CD in front of me...</font>

257
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:39,540
<font size="38">I'll definitely choose Nogizaka46's. I'll buy their CD!</font>

258
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:44,880
<font size="38">The next member for the talk is Kawamura Mahiro.</font>

259
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:49,780
<font size="38">Kawamura, you started to dance during 3rd year in primary school? -Yes.</font>

260
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:55,320
<font size="38">During that time, around second semester my friend asked me to learn Hip Hop together with them.</font>

261
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:59,220
<font size="38">Your mother always accompanied you when you had dance lessons.</font>

262
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:07,100
<font size="38">After that, you always buy and eat breads together with your mother. -That's right.</font>

263
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:11,940
<font size="38">Lately, you discovered a food chain store in the city that sells the same food</font>

264
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:14,380
<font size="38">And you cried after you ate it?</font>

265
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,960
<font size="38">What happened? Homesick?</font>

266
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:32,220
<font size="38">You know, this kid worked very hard on her dancing skill since she was small.</font>

267
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:35,060
<font size="38">After knowing that she did not make it into the Shichifukujin</font>

268
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:37,900
<font size="38">she went to the Karaoke by herself for 3 hours.</font>

269
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:42,300
<font size="38">To escape from the sad feeling huh? </font>

270
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:48,620
<font size="38">Even she's kinda like a happy go lucky, deep down inside she still has ambitions.</font>

271
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:55,660
<font size="38">Lastly who once again entered the senbatsu, Saito Yuri.</font>

272
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:57,640
<font size="38">You modeled for Tamago Club* when you're still a baby?</font>

273
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:03,120
<font face="Times New Roman" size="32">{\an8}Tamago Kurabu たまごクラブ. A Japanese magazine that usually talks about pregnancy & motherhood. Usually featured mothers and babies photoshoot in it.</font>

274
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:08,140
<font size="38">But actually I do not have a clear memory of it since its around my first and a half year.</font>

275
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:11,120
<font size="38">My mother probably went to apply for it on a whim.</font>

276
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:16,040
<font size="38">Are you kawai since from the start? -Not kawai at all.</font>

277
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:21,400
<font size="38">There's a lot of cases of babies that are really cute but not so good when they grew up(their looks).</font>

278
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:25,360
<font size="38">-You're these cute from the start, right? -There's really nothing cute about me.</font>

279
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:30,180
<font size="38">Ummm...Saito Yuri has some kind of bad habit, you know?</font>

280
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:34,060
<font size="38">You like to touch other people's butt.</font>

281
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:44,540
<font size="38">She really wanted to touch members' butt to the point that nothing could not hold her back.</font>

282
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,860
<font size="38">What's so funny about it?</font>

283
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:52,860
<font size="38">That's because you're just <s>a total pervert</s> weird. Touching people's butt etc.</font>

284
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:56,880
<font size="38">I had the urge to do it everytime we were practicing.</font>

285
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,160
<font size="38">Urge? I beg your pardon?</font>

286
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:02,320
<font size="38">What do you mean urge?</font>

287
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,180
<font size="38">The urge to touch them?</font>

288
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:11,060
<font size="38">Everytime they danced they also shaked their body, right?</font>

289
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:17,600
<font size="38">I wanted to touch them but we were still practicing so I had to hold back.</font>

290
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:21,920
<font size="38">The only chance I get was when the teacher's explaining stuff in front... </font>

291
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:25,320
<font size="38">Wait... how's that not a pervert!?</font>

292
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:29,580
<font size="38">Those who got their butt touched by Saito Yuri please raise your hand.</font>

293
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:33,540
<font size="38">Wait, what? Everyone has been touched before!? Really?</font>

294
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:35,240
<font size="38">Was it like a big grab?</font>

295
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,220
<font face="Times New Roman" size="32">{\an8}Well played Shiraishi.</font>

296
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,960
<font size="38">She just used her fingertips to tease you?</font>

297
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:42,840
<font size="38">That's kinda NG, right?</font>

298
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:46,840
<font size="38">Sometimes she just grabbed the whole butt.</font>

299
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:50,300
<font size="38">She even surprised us during events.</font>

300
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:51,740
<font size="38">During events!?</font>

301
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:53,980
<font size="38">Even in front of the fans?</font>

302
00:20:58,770 --> 00:20:58,820
<font size="38">She'll stand behind when there's a crowd and do this...</font>

303
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:04,300
<font size="38">I never thought something I did would be discovered. I'm sorry.</font>

304
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:10,940
<font size="38">You even put your hand inside Sakurai's skirt.</font>

305
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:15,840
<font size="38">She abruptly put her hand inside my skirt.</font>

306
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,360
<font size="38">That's funny.</font>

307
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:22,080
<font size="38">Inside your skirt?</font>

308
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:26,140
<font size="38">She did it like this and I was like "No no no no...stop it!"</font>

309
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,580
<font size="38">But like what she did.</font>

310
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:35,920
<font size="38">maybe in the future when,</font>

311
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:39,660
<font size="38">all of you have concerts or other stuff and she grabs your butt</font>

312
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:43,520
<font size="38">and you say "Yameteh," that kind of stuff might ease the nervousness.</font>

313
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,460
<font size="38">Only if you guys are comfortable with it.</font>

314
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:49,700
<font size="38">The same goes for me too. Everytime before a broadcast...</font>

315
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:52,660
<font size="38">Himura-san was really nervous, every time.</font>

316
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:57,100
<font size="38">I usually kicked his butt or stab his anus.</font>

317
00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:00,220
<font size="38">Gave him a big clap on the back.</font>

318
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:05,000
<font size="38">He'll say "Stop it!" So something like that will relieve him.</font>

319
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:10,600
<font size="38">Interesting. Very Interesting. -Where can you find a idol like this?</font>

320
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:16,720
<font size="38">After this, Nogizaka46 will be visiting Nogi Shrine for their debut single.</font>

321
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:21,860
<font size="38">Their ambition for this year was really big, what could it be?</font>

322
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:31,040
<font size="38">January 5th, 2012. Nogizaka's members visited the Nogi Shrine located at Minato, Tokyo.</font>

323
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:40,520
<font size="38">This is a big day for Nogizaka46 who's going to debut on February.</font>

324
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:48,600
<font size="38">Praying for their debut single, wishing it to become a big hit.</font>

325
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:56,520
<font size="38">Let's listen to their "first dream of the year"* from the members.</font>

326
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,440
<font face="Times New Roman" size="32">{\an8}初夢(Hatsuyume はつゆめ). Usually refers to the one you dream on the night of January 1st going into the 2nd and is supposed to fortell how good your year will be.</font>

327
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:03,380
<font size="38">I dreamt of a scene where I caught a fish. </font>

328
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:10,960
<font size="38">Because it's my first dream, so I think it will be a good year for me.</font>

329
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:16,220
<font size="38">Next up, Nogizaka46's first fan meeting event of the year.</font>

330
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:21,920
<font size="38">Nogizaka46's New Year Blessing Event has started!</font>

331
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,000
<font size="38">First off, knocking the rice cakes and</font>

332
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:31,680
<font size="38">every member revealed their own wish for this year.</font>

333
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:37,920
<font size="38">2012 has become the year when Nogizka46 first debuted!</font>

334
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:42,360
<font size="38">I'm sure that there will be changes in the future</font>

335
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:48,000
<font size="38">so please continue to support Nogizaka46, we'll be really happy if you do!</font>

336
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:54,220
<font size="38">My personal goal is to hold a concert on Budoken one day.</font>

337
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:57,260
<font size="38">One two... Our goal Budoken!</font>

338
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:03,480
<font size="38">A good result was shown even right before they debuted on 22nd Febraury.</font>

339
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:06,080
<font size="38">Please keep on supporting them!</font>

340
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:11,840
<font size="38">After this, the girls met a bigwig in an elevator!?</font>

341
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:16,140
<font size="38">How will Nogizaka46 react to these!?</font>

342
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:24,820
<font size="38">Next week on Nogizakatte, Doko?</font>

343
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:31,280
<font size="38">The girls are learning about "What should you do if you met a bigwig."</font>
