00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:41,780
<font size="38">Unexpected and weird answers one after another!</font>

<font size="38">The correct answer appeared!</font>

5
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,940
<font size="38">Is it ok to be an Idol if they're vulgar?</font>

6
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,060
<font size="38">What actually happened!?</font>

7
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,980

00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:19,760
<font size="38">Nogizakatte, Doko? has started! We're the MC Bananaman!</font>

14
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,100
<font size="38">These are the members for today!</font>

15
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,880
<font size="38">Our guest for today, Hamaguchi-san*! Yoroshiku!</font>

16
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:36,080
<font face="Times New Roman" size="32">{\an8}Japanese comedian, and actor.</font>

17
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,400
<font size="38">Same as the last time, we invited the fans to our studio.</font>

18
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:43,700
<font size="38">-There's a lot of fans here! -Thanks for coming!</font>

19
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:47,720
<font size="38">So for today's plan, Himura-san.</font>

20
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,680
<font size="38">What's the plan?</font>

21
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:52,260
<font size="38">Please read the plan while acting cute.</font>

22
00:03:52,260 --> 00:04:01,380
<font size="38">Yes~ alright~  I'm realli cute and funny too~ Nogizaka Comedy~~</font>

23
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:06,560
<font size="38">Speaking of comedy, the girls should know a few of it right?</font>

24
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,240
<font size="38">Because comedy appeared on different shows very often.</font>

25
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:10,240
<font size="38">Like AIUEO Sakubon* and "Nazokake*, MC like to use them during a show.</font>

26
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:14,200
<font face="Times New Roman" size="32">{\an8}Both are a form of wordplay jokes in Japanese.</font>

27
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,140
<font size="38">So you wanna do an AIUEO Sakubon?</font>

28
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:20,780
<font size="38">Well...this is not the time to betray me.</font>

29
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:30,160
<font face="Times New Roman" size="30">Today's questions were already answered beforehand by the members before the recording.</font>

30
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,860
<font size="38">Although we'll be looking at some of the weird answers,</font>

31
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:39,460
<font size="38">but if all of them were really lame, 
Hamaguchi-san will answer instead.</font>

32
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,700
<font size="38">He even bought his own equipment for this.</font>

33
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:44,800
<font size="38">well-prepared?</font>

34
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,680
<font size="38">I bought a lot of cards today, I'm totally prepared.</font>

35
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:54,600
<font size="38">Before the recording, I was told to prepare some witty answers.</font>

36
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,860
<font size="38">It'll be better if Himura-san could...</font>

37
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:57,780
<font size="60">Nani!?</font>

38
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,160
<font size="38">Friendly-fire.</font>

39
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,120
<font size="38">I might ask you later, so you should kinda prepare too.</font>

40
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:06,620
<font size="38">Aha...Ummm...I'm kinda pissed when you said that.</font>

41
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:09,000
<font size="38">Everyone, please help us too.</font>

42
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,980
<font size="38">I might even ask the fans too.</font>

43
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,720
<font size="38">They'll be like "Eh!? Really!?"</font>

44
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:18,300
<font size="38">If you were picked, just laugh.</font>

45
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:22,460
<font size="38">Let's get started!</font>

46
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:24,400
<font size="38">The first question is...</font>

47
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:28,780
<font size="38">There's a "dating ban" rule in AKB48,</font>

48
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:34,340
<font size="38">other than that, what are the other rules people do not know?</font>

49
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:37,240
<font size="38">So there might be those unspoken rules...</font>

50
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,560
<font size="38">-The answer range is kinda wide. -Yes.</font>

51
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:41,860
<font size="38">We'll see how did you guys answer this question.</font>

52
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,280
<font size="38">Alright, first up is Ichiki's answer.</font>

53
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,560
<font size="38">Oh, it's here!</font>

54
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:48,520
<font size="38">Ichiki's answer is the following, let's see.</font>

55
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:53,660
<font size="38">"Only buy the electric appliance in Akihabara!!"</font>

56
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:58,100
<font size="38">Yes. I had an inspiration earlier.</font>

57
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,620
<font size="38">Akihabara. Interesting.</font>

58
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,620
<font size="38">Not bad as the first answer.</font>

59
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:10,140
<font size="38">The answer was smooth and stable. Not bad.</font>

60
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:13,480
<font size="38">The flattering words from two comedians with each up to 20 years of comedy experiences.</font>

61
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,580
<font size="38">Just in case.</font>

62
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:18,580
<font size="38">So next up, Inoue's answer.</font>

63
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:20,940
<font size="38">What's the other rule people do not know?</font>

64
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,600
<font size="38">"Don't catch a cold."</font>

65
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,540
<font size="38">Oh!! This is important!</font>

66
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:30,780
<font size="38">I mean it's not for Nogizaka only, everyone should not catch a cold!</font>

67
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:32,460
<font size="38">It's like a worldwide rule.</font>

68
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:36,860
<font size="38">During the recording, a few members caught a cold,</font>

69
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:40,120
<font size="38">and we kinda caused some troubles.</font>

70
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,160
<font size="38">I know right!</font>

71
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:44,660
<font size="38">Even if you wrote a small matter like this, it's still funny!</font>

72
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:46,220
<font size="38">That's nice! Not bad, not bad!</font>

73
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:49,240
<font size="38">Not bad too as the second answer.</font>

74
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,260
<font size="38">How strange.</font>

75
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:53,300
<font size="38">No matter what was written, these two will always be giving tons of feedback.</font>

76
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:54,340
<font size="38">A new type of jokes.</font>

77
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:58,460
<font size="38">How interesting. This might become a new oogiri's segment.</font>

78
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:01,860
<font size="38">All credit goes to the girls.</font>

79
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,800
<font size="38">Next up, Ikoma's answer.</font>

80
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,800
<font size="38">What's the other rule people do not know?</font>

81
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:07,740
<font size="38">"Marriage is ok."</font>

82
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:09,520
<font face="Times New Roman" size="32">{\an8}*cough* AKB's 49th Sousenkyo *cough*</font>

83
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,820
<font size="38">Oh, I see.</font>

84
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:14,740
<font size="38">No dating, but if it's marriage, it's ok?</font>

85
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:17,300
<font size="38">I thought that they can just skip the dating part.</font>

86
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:21,680
<font size="38">Like the other countries, where they met their fianc√© only during their wedding ceremony.</font>

87
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,820
<font size="38">Well if that's the case, I think it's ok.</font>

88
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:27,460
<font size="38">Kinda like finding a loophole.</font>

89
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:31,540
<font size="38">Yes. I finally got to see the smart side of Ikoma.</font>

90
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:36,400
<font size="38">Please beware of these two's endless feedbacks!</font>

91
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:43,100
<font size="38">Alright, the last one which was Shiraishi's answer.</font>

92
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:48,100
<font size="38">What's the other rule in AKB48 that others do not know?</font>

93
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,560
<font size="38">"No farting."</font>

94
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,560
<font face="Times New Roman" size="32">{\an8}@Oshima Yuko</font>

95
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:56,340
<font size="38">Not just for AKB but for other idols too, right?</font>

96
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:58,340
<font size="38">You guys do not fart, right?</font>

97
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,500
<font size="38">But...</font>

98
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:00,200
<font size="60">But!?</font>

99
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:00,960
<font size="38">Spilling the bean!?</font>

100
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,140
<font size="38">Nani?</font>

101
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:06,720
<font size="38">Are you trying to betray your fellow members?</font>

102
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,260
<font size="38">That's bad.</font>

103
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:09,620
<font size="38">What happened?</font>

104
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:11,480
<font size="38">-Can I say it? -Sure, sure.</font>

105
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:15,540
<font size="38">We had a lesson before, and Saito Yuri was beside me.</font>

106
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:18,040
<font size="38">Wait you can't say that!</font>

107
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:22,100
<font size="38">She's like "I kinda wanna fart, may I?"</font>

108
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:29,040
<font size="38">After that, she kinda turned to where Sayuri (Inoue) was standing and released her chemical weapon.</font>

109
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:32,940
<font size="38">-No, it's nothing like that! -You can't do that!</font>

110
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,520
<font size="38">After I said that, Kazumi who was beside me said</font>

111
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:39,420
<font size="38">"Sure, but please fart at where Inoue's."</font>

112
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:41,380
<font size="38">The Mastermind?</font>

113
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:44,240
<font size="38">What's the meaning of this!?</font>

114
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:49,160
<font size="38">-But Yuri said "Ah...it won't come out," and she went back. 
-Yes, I did not fart.</font>

115
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:53,340
<font size="38">-Since you're an idol. -Yes, I'll never fart as an idol!</font>

116
00:08:54,700 --> 00:09:00,320
<font size="38">You didn't! You couldn't! No discussion!</font>

117
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,160
<font size="38">Not bad!</font>

118
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,600
<font size="38">Well, it's the time to listen to their answers.</font>

119
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:06,620
<font size="38">Ah...ummm...</font>

120
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:11,540
<font size="38">The standard answers...</font>

121
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:15,540
<font size="38">What kind of show pulled out an answer from a plastic bag.</font>

122
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:17,160
<font size="38">Well, this will do.</font>

123
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,000
<font size="38">Alright, let's go.</font>

124
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:25,300
<font size="38">What's the other rule in AKB48 that others do not know?</font>

125
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:28,300
<font size="38">"Don't use "rock paper scissors" to decide everything."</font>

126
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:30,480
<font face="Times New Roman" size="32">{\an8}*cough* Janken Tournament *cough*</font>

127
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,640
<font size="38">Ah, not bad!</font>

128
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:36,120
<font size="38">Well, I mean...there's more...</font>

129
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:39,880
<font size="38">Not one answer for one question?</font>

130
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:43,180
<font size="38">What do you mean? Only one answer for each question.</font>

131
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:45,180
<font size="38">Not just one time?</font>

132
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:46,820
<font size="38">You're really scary.</font>

133
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:50,760
<font size="38">If there are good answers it would be easier for the editors.</font>

134
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:55,680
<font size="38">"Do not meet face to face with SDN48."</font>

135
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:02,940
<font size="38">-This is a good one too. -Sugoi!</font>

136
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:05,340
<font size="38">What's the other rule in AKB48 that others do not know?</font>

137
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:10,280
<font size="38">"Don't think that everyone who wears suit and glasses is Producer Akimoto."</font>

138
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:13,140
<font size="38">Please use the one with "SDN" as my answer.</font>

139
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:19,080
<font size="38">Alright, let's continue. The next question is...</font>

140
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:23,060
<font size="38">The title for a new song which makes us think</font>

141
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:28,660
<font size="38">"Aki-p were you being lazy?" So what's the title?</font>

142
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:34,420
<font size="38">If they did not answer well enough, they'll get scolded.</font>

143
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:37,580
<font size="38">-First up, Hashimoto's answer. -Yes.</font>

144
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:41,860
<font size="38">Aki-p's lazy new song title is...</font>

145
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:44,000
<font size="38">"Someday, Kachuusha."</font>

147
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,100
<font size="38">Not bad. It's not "everyday."</font>

148
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:55,060
<font size="38">-Incredible! -Not bad! Not bad at all!</font>

149
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:02,020
<font size="38">That's a typical standard answer for oogiri shows' opening.</font>

150
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:05,880
<font size="38">Yes. Just change a few words and you got a standard oogiri answer.</font>

151
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:09,200
<font size="38">That's right. A few changes and it's already funny.</font>

152
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,360
<font size="38">Next up, Mastumura's.</font>

153
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,700
<font size="38">Aki-p's lazy new song title is...</font>

154
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:19,940
<font size="38">"Heavy Rotation, probably?"</font>

155
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:22,000
<font size="38">"probably" has become a series.</font>

156
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
<font size="38">Not bad!</font>

157
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,080
<font size="38">-Did you come up with that? -Yes.</font>

158
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:28,540
<font size="38">You got talent girl~</font>

159
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:33,820
<font size="38">Not bad right, for these bunch of kids.</font>

160
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,600
<font size="38">Next up, Nishino's.</font>

161
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:42,200
<font size="38">Aki-p's lazy new song title is...</font>

162
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,660
<font size="38">"Guruguru Curtain 2."</font>

163
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:48,620
<font size="38">He's definitely being lazy.</font>

164
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:54,060
<font size="38">Maybe the next song will be "#3."</font>

165
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:57,820
<font size="38">After this, there'll be no other songs except "Guruguru Curtain."</font>

166
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:00,960
<font size="38">"Why the same old outfit..."</font>

167
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:05,060
<font size="38">They might even reach "#14."</font>

168
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:08,480
<font size="38">The road for them, just like that until the end.</font>

169
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,760
<font size="38">Next up, Takayama.</font>

170
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,520
<font size="38">Not bad, Takayama.</font>

171
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:12,740
<font size="38">Wait, we haven't show her answer yet.</font>

172
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:13,020
<font size="38">Can't resist.</font>

173
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:17,020
<font size="38">Can't help but to give feedbacks, it happened often.</font>

174
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:20,680
<font size="38">Like when the feet of a runner leaves the starting blocks before the starter‚Äôs gun.</font>

175
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:25,480
<font size="38">Let's continue with Takayama's answer. Aki-p's lazy new song title is...</font>

176
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:28,420
<font size="38">"Please look forward to it next time."</font>

177
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,960
<font size="38">-So for this time, we just give up the song? -Yes.</font>

178
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:39,680
<font size="38">That's bad if someone was told with it, "so...there's a next song?"</font>

179
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,680
<font size="38">Hatanaka's answer,</font>

180
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,380
<font size="38">Aki-p's lazy new song title is...</font>

181
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,460
<font size="38">"Hill!!(Saka)"</font>

182
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,700
<font size="38">How did you come up with this?</font>

183
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,740
<font size="38">Like the feeling of climbing a hill.</font>

184
00:12:55,740 --> 00:13:01,220
<font size="38">Oh, I get it. Going up the hill(saka) and rolling down(guruguru)...</font>

185
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:05,140
<font size="38">Will "Nogizaka" be referred as "Saka?"</font>

186
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:07,140
<font size="38">"Nogizaka."</font>

187
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:10,480
<font size="38">If we slowly changed it to "Saka," that'll be nice right?</font>

188
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:13,960
<font size="38">Our guest for today is "Saka."</font>

189
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,620
<font size="38">"Today I climbed a hill(saka)."</font>

190
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:20,800
<font size="38">After this, "going to a live concert" will be referred as "climbing a hill."</font>

191
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,560
<font size="38">Not bad, not bad!</font>

192
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,440
<font size="38">So it's decided, no more "Nogizaka."</font>

193
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,940
<font size="38">Kawamura's Aki-p's lazy new song title is...</font>

194
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,640
<font size="38">"Dung Beetles."</font>

195
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:39,680
<font size="38">-Oh! -It became really bad!</font>

196
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:45,680
<font size="38">That's incredible. So kids these days like these kinds of stuff.</font>

197
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:49,640
<font size="38">Yabai! These two will give positive comments no matter what.</font>

198
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:54,820
<font size="38">Well, at least she wrote it.</font>

199
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,820
<font size="38">How do we sing it?</font>

200
00:13:56,820 --> 00:14:03,080
<font size="38">"Dung beetles~ Dung dung dung~"</font>

201
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:07,000
<font size="38">So the lyrics are going to be "Dung beetles~ Dung dung dung~"</font>

202
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,820
<font size="38">Next up, Ito Nene's.</font>

203
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:12,580
<font size="38">Aki-p's lazy new song title is...</font>

206
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:21,020
<font size="38">How does it sound? "Mori~ mori~ supplied~ food~"</font>

207
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:23,380
<font size="38">It totally sounded like a plagiarized song.</font>

208
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:25,380
<font size="38">"Everyone~ let's eat~"</font>

209
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,040
<font size="38">This is actually lazy. When you heard the song "Eh!?"</font>

210
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,080
<font size="38">Let's check out sensei's.</font>

211
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,160
<font size="38">Example!</font>

212
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,620
<font size="38">Don't know whose answer is better yet. Even dung beetles appeared.</font>

213
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:43,740
<font size="38">Aki-p's lazy new song title is...</font>

214
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:47,380
<font size="38">"I took off my sailor uniform, probably?"</font>

215
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:51,740
<font size="38">-It's the "probably" series. 
-It'll be better if I showed this during the opening.</font>

216
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:53,420
<font size="38">Ah, right...the "probably" series.</font>

217
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:55,420
<font size="38">But the girls already showed it.</font>

218
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,420
<font size="38">So do you have more?</font>

219
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:01,420

<font size="38">Ah! Not bad!</font>

224
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:15,540
<font size="38">Like "Ue kara Mariko."</font>

229
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,160

00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:54,560
<font size="38">This kind of Idol that will never become popular! So what it is?</font>

235
00:15:56,860 --> 00:16:08,380
<font size="38">"Ya won't become famous ya know?" x500</font>

<font size="38">-Ya won't become famous! -Ya won't become famous!</font>

240
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:27,300
<font size="38">What kind of Idol is that?</font>

241
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:31,280
<font size="38">Eh, like she only has a pretty face?</font>

242
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:35,820
<font size="38">Next, Takayama's.</font>

243
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,820
<font size="38">Not bad, Takayama's.</font>

244
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:43,240
<font size="38">-Wait, we haven't shown it yet. -Not bad right, Takayama's.</font>

248
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:57,780
<font size="38">Like only become the center when it's a leap year.</font>

249
00:16:57,780 --> 00:17:01,120
<font size="38">Umm, a leap year does not appear every three years. -Eh!?</font>

250
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,920
<font size="38">-It's once every four years. -Four? Ah! I messed up!</font>

<font size="38">Yes, I'm taking exam this year.</font>

257
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:33,140
<font size="38">There are others that work as Idol while studying too right?</font>

258
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:39,360
<font size="38">You have to prepare for exams and these oogiri answers...Sugoi.</font>

259
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,180
<font size="38">You should have declined it.</font>

260
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:45,800
<font size="38">The kind of Idol that will never become popular is?</font>

<font size="38">Those who forgot?</font>

264
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:56,440
<font size="38">Like, "ready, set...Eh??"</font>

265
00:17:56,920 --> 00:18:02,240
<font size="38">Just like Nogizaka's introduction, "one, two...Eh??"</font>
