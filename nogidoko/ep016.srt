<font size="38">Title call, please.</font>

225
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,880
<font size="38">Please read it while imitating someone else's voices.</font>

226
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:08,500
<font size="38">Definitely useful impersonation lesson.</font>

227
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:14,440
<font size="38">Everyone should've one impersonation skill, right?</font>

228
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:18,480
<font size="38">Maybe when there's a punishment game they will ask you to imitate someone.</font>

229
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:21,640
<font size="38">Let the guests give you a lesson. -Is that right? That's good.</font>

230
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:24,700
<font size="38">Haraguchi-san, yoroshiku onegaishimasu.</font>

231
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:30,700
<font size="38">Let's learn how to do a Ken Shimura impression from Haraguchi-sensei.</font>

232
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:32,700
<font size="38">Basically, act like an old lady.</font>

233
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,500
<font size="38">Your pose should be like an old lady.</font>

234
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,500
<font size="38">And you need to do a sour-face.</font>

235
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,900
<font size="38">When you have a sour-face, this voice will come out naturally.</font>

236
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:50,580
<font size="38">You're good if you can do this voice.</font>

237
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,740
<font size="38">Everyone let's stand up.</font>

238
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:57,840
<font size="38">Let's become an old lady.</font>

239
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,880
<font size="38">I'm sorry but I can't see anyone right now.</font>

240
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,640
<font size="38">Looking at the floor.</font>

241
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:04,040
<font size="38">Lets say "Ah~~" together. Ready...</font>

242
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:07,980
<font size="38">Ah~~~</font>

243
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:13,540
<font size="38">Alright. There's one line that I hoped you guys could say it out loud.</font>

244
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:16,420
<font size="38">"Well I'm always alone anyway!!""</font>

245
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:22,860
<font size="38">When you act it out think of it as Shimura-san was asked to take someone's order.</font>

246
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:28,000
<font size="38">Like...What do you want to eat? Ok one ramen. Ok one dumpling.</font>

247
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,300
<font size="38">"Well I'm always alone anyway!!"</font>

248
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:34,760
<font size="38">Just remember to add that line inside your acts.</font>

249
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:46,280
<font size="38">We're we going to add that line ok?</font>

250
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,740
<font size="38">"Well I'm always alone anyway!" </font>

251
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:51,020
<font size="38">What a weird group.</font>

252
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:54,220
<font size="38">Ikoma look hyped when she did that.</font>

253
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:57,580
<font size="38">Ikoma and Takayama both look really hyped.</font>

254
00:14:57,580 --> 00:15:00,380
<font size="38">We're starting with the "Ah~~" ok? Ready...</font>

255
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:01,900
<font size="38">"Well I'm always alo...."</font>

256
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:02,720
<font size="38">We haven't reached that part yet!!</font>

257
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,020
<font size="38">Sneaky Beaky.</font>

258
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:08,360
<font size="38">From "Ah~~" ok? Not the line first.</font>

259
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:12,440
<font size="38">"Well I'm always alone anyway!"</font>

260
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,180
<font size="38">Ikoma's good!</font>

261
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:15,160
<font size="38">"Well I'm always alone anyway!"</font>

262
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:18,060
<font size="38">Ah sorry, I added a bit of Akita dialect... -It's ok.</font>

263
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:22,220
<font size="38">Ah~~~ One two...</font>

264
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:25,400
<font size="38">"Well I'm always alone anyway!"</font>

265
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:29,140
<font size="38">Next up Koji-sensei is going to teach us about Tamori's* impression.</font>

266
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:34,360
<font face="Times New Roman" size="32">{\an8}A famous host for Music Station.</font>

267
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:41,040
<font size="38">So, face expression first. Firstly, raise your eyebrows really high.</font>

268
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,880
<font size="38">Like this, raise it up like this and you're good. </font>

269
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:49,640
<font size="38">After that, you need to stretch your nose down. </font>

270
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,780
<font size="38">Keep that expression and grin.</font>

271
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,640
<font size="38">This is the basic form.</font>

272
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:02,280
<font size="38">After that just say something randomly during an interview.</font>

273
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,280
<font size="38">"What a small face."</font>

274
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:10,140
<font size="38">Or maybe "He's really good at talking."</font>

275
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:16,680
<font size="38">While everyone's doing it, let the excited Hashimoto become our representative.</font>

276
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:22,980
<font size="38">Hashimoto's going to accept the challenge as the representative.</font>

277
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:24,980
<font size="38">Not bad, not bad.</font>

278
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:29,400
<font size="38">Raise your eyebrows and pull your nose.</font>

279
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:32,040
<font size="38">Oh not bad at all.</font>

280
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,220
<font size="38">Pick someone to have an interview with.</font>

281
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:36,220
<font size="38">There's something funny about that.</font>

282
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:40,120
<font size="38">Doing that kind of expression while wearing a sunglasses.</font>

283
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,900
<font size="38">Wait a sec. They actually looked alike!</font>

284
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:45,800
<font size="38">New talent found!</font>

285
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,220
<font size="38">The way she holds the mic is really good too!</font>

286
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:51,560
<font size="38">Let's have a talk with the members behind you.</font>

287
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:54,340
<font size="38">"What were you saying!?" Something like that.</font>

288
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,100
<font size="38">You were you saying?</font>

289
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:01,160
<font size="38">I umm... I think it's really interesting...</font>

290
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,500
<font size="38">"Yeah it's interesting. It's interesting after all."</font>

291
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:08,040
<font size="38">"Yeah it's interesting. It's interesting after all."</font>

292
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,180
<font size="38">Music Station?</font>

293
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:15,060
<font size="38">I guess only Hashimoto can imitate Tamori-san this well.</font>

294
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:17,640
<font size="38">Her face looks similar too.</font>

295
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:24,480
<font size="38">After this, imitation battle between a mountain goat and Tamori-san!</font>

296
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:29,880
<font size="38">Say...Himura know how to imitate an animal, right?</font>

297
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,180
<font size="38">Yeah sure, I can do it.</font>

298
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:34,660
<font size="38">Let's start, shall we?</font>

299
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:36,560
<font size="38">Alright...a goat.</font>

300
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,700
<font size="38">What a realistic screaming.</font>

301
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:56,160
<font size="38">There's someone else who can do this kind of voice.</font>

302
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:01,840
<font size="38">Koji Kato can do that.</font>

303
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,220
<font size="38">If you can do the goat's you probably can do Kato-san's too.</font>

304
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:09,780
<font size="38">"You can do that too."</font>

305
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,480
<font size="38">"You can do that too."</font>

306
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,500
<font size="38">"Laugh like that."</font>

307
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:23,160
<font size="38">Why did you turn to a goat when you laughed.</font>

308
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:28,100
<font size="38">Oh looks like someone's good at it. Takayama.</font>

309
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,180
<font size="38">Here I go.</font>

310
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,780
<font size="38">Lets do a talk between a male and a female goat.</font>

311
00:18:45,100 --> 00:19:02,100

<font size="38">Ended. </font>
