11
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:48,140
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">The members are not here</font>

12
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:51,250
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">The members were all hospitalized</font>

13
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:52,600

24
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:23,990

<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Last year when we said this, Hashimoto said something like</font>

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,550
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">As long as you say it sexily it's fine.</font>

00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:25,580
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">It's dangerous.</font>

273
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:26,340
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">You shouldn't say that.</font>

274
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:28,020
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">It's the changing of tires at the pit stop...</font>

275
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:31,030
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">It makes you think what kind of a tire is it, you know.</font>

276
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:31,680
<font size="40"><b>{\an5}CAN CHANGE AS MANY AS YOU LIKE</b></font>

277
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,650
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">The more you say it the worse it becomes.</font>

278
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:33,660
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">It's useless whatever you say.</font>

279
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:34,440
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">We are thankful though.</font>

280
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,930
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">This kind of thing is for us to say</font>

281
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:38,430
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">And the last one, Ikoma.</font>

282
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,570
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">I said your phrase before you, I'm sorry.</font>

283
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:42,830
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">You know the recent Amachan craze</font>

284
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:44,340
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">I am told a lot that it suits me.</font>

285
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:46,040
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">You appeared in the show before right?</font>

286
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:49,500
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">It suits you to the extent that it wouldn't be strange if you were to be added to the cast</font>

287
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:54,220
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">I'm a huge fan so today I will only say "Je Je Je"</font>

288
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:55,790
<font size="40"><b>{\an5}"JE JE JE" DECLARATION</b></font>

289
00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:00,270
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">After this, a heated game tournament.</font>

290
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:07,470
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Let's heat up the party by playing various party games in those costumes.</font>

291
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:10,630
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Let's play the first game. Himura-san please announce it.</font>

292
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:14,180
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">First game is "Nogizaka Fruits Basket"!</font>

293
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:21,820
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">One member will be "it" and others will be sitting,</font>

294
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:24,840
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">"it" will read the paper she picked out of the box</font>

295
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:27,450
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">and the members that fit the description in the paper will change seats.</font>

296
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:33,570
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">The one that is unable to sit becomes the "it".</font>

297
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:39,200
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">After playing for 10 times, the member that has been "it" for the most time will receive a punishment</font>

298
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,730
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">The first "it" is?</font>

299
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:45,880
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Are there anyone that wants to be "it"?</font>

300
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:46,300
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Yes.</font>

301
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:47,280
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">That's good.</font>

302
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,160
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">This will count as being "it" once too</font>

303
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:53,010
<font size="40"><b>{\an5}THINK BEFORE YOU ACT</b></font>

304
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:54,610
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Were you surprised?</font>

305
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:55,120
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Oh! That's good.</font>

306
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,040
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Je Je Je~</font>

307
00:10:57,090 --> 00:11:01,020
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">It's not good to say "I'll do it" to everything.</font>

308
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:06,000
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Then, let's start. We will search for the ones that didn't move even though the description fits them.</font>

309
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:09,280
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Because it's not fun if you don't move.</font>

310
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:09,780
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Yes.</font>

311
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:12,070
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">It could end with Ikoma being the "it" for 10 times in a row.</font>

312
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:12,890
<font size="40"><b>{\an5}ENDS WITHOUT ANYONE MOVING</b></font>

313
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:15,430
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Please, not that.</font>

314
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:18,820
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Please change your seats with all your power.</font>

315
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:21,430
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Then let's start with Ikoma being "it".</font>

316
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:23,720
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">"Nogizaka Fruits Basket" start!</font>

317
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:26,290

318
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:27,340
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Read it.</font>

319
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:29,680
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">The ones that can't study.</font>

320
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,870
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Here it goes.</font>

321
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:37,130
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">So it's like that.</font>

322
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:41,140
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Who is not bad at studying? The ones that didn't move raise your hands.</font>

323
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:43,780
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">The ones that didn't move raise your hands.</font>

324
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:46,930
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Ah, Matsumura definitely should've moved.</font>

325
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:48,300
<font size="40"><b>{\an5}AREN'T YOU BAD AT STUDYING?</b></font>

327
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:49,750
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">What's not that?</font>

328
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:54,000
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Everyone moves faster than I thought so I couldn't move.</font>

329
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,460
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">That's the point of this game you know.</font>

330
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:57,750
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">I was shocked.</font>

331
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,440
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Please turn your switch on.</font>

332
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,050
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">You are really bad at studying, right?</font>

333
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:02,260
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Well, not good.</font>

334
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:06,180
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">If it happens next time, I'll count you as "it" once as a penalty.</font>

335
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:07,860
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">I'm sorry.</font>

336
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:12,350
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">This time let's watch out for the penalty and start the 2nd round.</font>

337
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:15,050
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">After you pick and look at the paper,</font>

338
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:17,680
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">you can check for people that might move.</font>

339
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:20,010
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">You can read after checking.</font>

340
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,690
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Let's start the 2nd round.</font>

341
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:25,510
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Get ready to move right away.</font>

342
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:27,320
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">But only if it fits you.</font>

343
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:30,290
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">The ones not from Tokyo.</font>

345
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:38,730
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Matsumura!</font>

346
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:39,810
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">It's Matsumura!</font>

347
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:45,960
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">At the end, your fight with Kawago for the chair was hard to look at.</font>

348
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,250
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Next is the 3rd round.</font>

349
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:52,880
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">And the topic is...</font>

350
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,220
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Ah~ I see.</font>

351
00:12:56,220 --> 00:13:00,020
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Takayama's outfit is the easiest to move in.</font>

352
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:01,360
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">You have the advantage.</font>

00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:03,320
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">She is waiting with her legs open.</font>

354
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:05,590
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Close your legs for now.</font>

355
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:07,630
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">I'm reading.</font>

356
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,550
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">The ones that are frequently late!</font>

357
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,170
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Hashimoto moved.</font>

358
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:14,430
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Oh, that's bad. That's bad</font>

359
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,140
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Eh, I can't believe it.</font>

360
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:19,140
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Even though many moved.</font>

361
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:23,400
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">The one closest to you moved. Why didn't you sit there?</font>

362
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,850
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">That's not it! When I saw this,</font>

363
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:26,820
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">I thought of Nanamin.</font>

364
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:28,870
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">I thought about going to Nanamin's seat.</font>

365
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,920
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">But Reika was really fast!</font>

366
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:32,470
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">She was really fast!</font>

367
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:36,120

368
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:37,880
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Who moved? Raise your hands.</font>

369
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:41,840
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">So these are the members that are always late.</font>

370
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:46,830
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">To the 4th round with Matsumura as "it" 2nd time in a row.</font>

371
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:50,050

377
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:05,270
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">I was sitting there from the start.</font>

378
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:07,190
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Ah! It was your seat.</font>

379
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:09,980

382
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:17,690

412
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:22,440
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">But right now we will be playing the 6th round and Matsumura has been "it" 3 times.</font>

413
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:25,160
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Most of the topics fit Matsumura.</font>

417
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:34,820

418
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:40,430
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">We move on to the 6th round with Matsumura at a slight disadvantage.</font>

00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:51,940
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">They are honest.</font>

425

<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Are there someone who knows a member who loves money?</font>

426
00:15:57,210 --> 00:15:58,090
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Right.</font>

427
00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:00,870
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Don't you all say "I want money" all the time?</font>

428
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:03,030
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">They say it all the time?</font>

429
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:05,930
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Takayama you moved because you love money.</font>

430
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,980
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">I really love money!</font>

431

432
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:16,400
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Next round, with the topic "the ones who are taller than 155cm" Shiraishi became "it".</font>

433
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:22,200
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">At the 8th round, Akimoto became the "it" with the topic "the ones that like Shitara more".</font>

434
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:26,930
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">9th round is starting with Matsumura in the lead.</font>

438
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,420
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Wouldn't it better to come a little more to the front?</font>
