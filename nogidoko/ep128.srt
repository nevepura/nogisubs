29
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:48,530
<font size="38"><b>No one is close among all the members.</b></font>

32
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:52,910
<font size="38"><b>Actually, she has a good relationship with all members.

<font size="38"><b>Higuchi.</b></font>

38
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:06,750
<font size="38"><b>But she got rejected.</b></font>

39
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:09,390
<font size="38"><b>After that, did you get something from her?</b></font>

40
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:13,310
<font size="38"><b>After the Valentine's show,
 I received a present from Naachan.</b></font>

41
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:15,160

42
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:19,480
<font size="38"><b>I felt bad inside.</b></font>

43
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:22,690
<font size="38"><b>It should be like that because you made Higuchi cry.</b></font>

44
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,610
<font size="38"><b>When she says, "I feel bad inside,"</b></font>

45
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:26,610
<font size="38"><b>she's actually like another version of Nakamori Akina.</b></font>

64

<font size="38"><b>It's the responsibility.</b></font>

65
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:51,690
<font size="38"><b>You ask yourself,
 if I received a position like this, can I do well?</b></font>

66
00:03:52,800 --> 00:04:00,130
<font size="38"><b>In Nishino's previous appearances...</b></font>

67
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:02,120
<font size="38"><b>It's okay.</b></font>

68
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:07,200
<font size="38"><b>I really like fat pigeons.</b></font>

69

72
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:31,210
<font size="38"><b>she will do it seriously. She really is like that.</b></font>

73
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:36,350
<font size="38"><b>In the activities that were done with her before,

77
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:50,030
<font size="38"><b>She has the personality of someone
 that does things perfectly.</b></font>

78
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:54,180
<font size="38"><b>Sometimes, she'll say some negative words,</b></font>

79
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:58,090
<font size="38"><b>but then she becomes more active, and she looks forward,</b></font>

80
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:00,840
<font size="38"><b>and she fights toward that direction.</b></font>

81
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:03,540
<font size="38"><b>Although we don't say it on TV,</b></font>

82
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:05,680
<font size="38"><b>Naachan is really weird you know.</b></font>

83
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:11,170
<font size="38"><b>At first, Naachan had habits that she did often.</b></font>

84
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:15,900
<font size="38"><b>Naachan pulled out her eyebrows

86
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:24,770
<font size="38"><b>Ah, I remember.</b></font>

87
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:26,770
<font size="38"><b>Naachan cuts her nails very short.</b></font>

88
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,400
<font size="38"><b>She does.</b></font>

89
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,660
<font size="38"><b>As the members said,</b></font>

90
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:34,920
<font size="38"><b>she has a hidden power in herself.</b></font>

91
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:39,460
<font size="38"><b>In this case, we are able to see some of this
 in the following video footage.</b></font>

92

97
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:58,410

98
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:01,060
<font size="38"><b>She also participates in interview.</b></font>

99
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:06,210
<font size="38"><b>I like to sing, but that doesn't mean I'm good at it.</b></font>

100
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:06,770
<font size="38"><b>So...</b></font>

101
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:10,750
<font size="38"><b>I really feel like I can't remember anything.</b></font>

102
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:14,910
<font size="38"><b>Behind her negative statements,

104
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:20,660
<font size="38"><b>she visits the stage for the first time.</b></font>

105
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:26,930
<font size="38"><b>On the day of the show,
 you won't have very much time to practice on stage.</b></font>

106
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:33,880
<font size="38"><b>Because the show is tomorrow, you will perform
 here today as if it were the real show.</b></font>

107
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:36,760
<font size="38"><b>Then rehearsal begins immediately.</b></font>

108
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:40,610
<font size="38"><b>To get rid of the nervousness before the live show,
 she begins rehearsal on the stage.</b></font>

109
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:47,070
<font size="38"><b>As the rehearsal proceeds, we also continue
 to monitor the performance backstage.</b></font>

110
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:53,070

111
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,120
<font size="38"><b>Are you nervous?
- Very nervous</b></font>

112
00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:00,590
<font size="38"><b>and also worried. I'm going ahead~</b></font>

113
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:02,370
<font size="38"><b>46!</b></font>

114
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:05,530
<font size="38"><b>And finally...</b></font>

115
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:19,580
<font size="38"><b>There were a few minor mistakes.</b></font>

116
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:22,400
<font size="38"><b>Maybe they won't realize it.</b></font>

117
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:27,630
<font size="38"><b>Although sometimes,
 facial expressions are difficult to see.</b></font>

118
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:30,930
<font size="38"><b>And at the end of the concert...</b></font>

119
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:38,280
<font size="38"><b>I, Nishino Nanase, was chosen to be the 8th single center.</b></font>

<font size="38"><b>After the concert ended,</b></font>

125
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:00,160
<font size="38"><b>There were also a number of statements from...</b></font>

126

131
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:27,300
<font size="38"><b>Yoroshiku onegaishimasu.</b></font>

132
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:34,880
