 announcement for the 7th single.

2
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:10,180
This time there will be many surprises.

3
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:17,690
Then, the new Nogizaka46 journey begins!

4
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,580
Nogizakatte, Doko?

DON!

7
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:42,700
Nogizakatte, Doko? has begun.
 I am the MC Bananaman, Shitara Osamu.

8
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:44,920
Then, this is Nogizaka-chan...

9
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:53,740
Okay, I'll announce tonight's theme.

10
00:00:53,740 --> 00:01:01,360
Nogizaka46's 7th single Senbatsu announcement!

11
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:12,080
Therefore as announced, this time the
 7th single Senbatsu announcement will be held.

12
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,760
First, the formation this time is...

13
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:19,580
First, I will announce the formation
 this time for the 7th single...

14
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:20,720
The 7th single formation.

15
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:21,160
- Here is the formation.
The 7th single formation.

16
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:21,300
- Here is the formation.

17
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:21,700
What's this?
- Here is the formation.

18
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:22,340
What's this?

19
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:23,060
Is this possible?

20
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:24,240
What's this?

21
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,120
Seventeen members?

22
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,520
Seventeen?

23
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:26,600
Usually there are only 16 members, but...
Seventeen?

24
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:30,240
Usually there are only 16 members, but...

25
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:34,760
Kikuchi-san...

26
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,580
There are 17 members in Senbatsu this time?

27
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:38,500
That is correct...

28
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:41,720
There are now 17 Senbatsu members.

29
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:43,520
Now...

30
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:47,060
The Senbatsu which usually contains
 16 members now contains 17.

31
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:51,240
The leading members are now the Fukujin 8 + 1.

32
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:56,000
All right, let's get started.

33
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,860
Okay, I'll begin announcing from the third row.

34
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,300
The first is...

35
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:01,840
Number 17.

36
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:06,080
The first to enter the Senbatsu is...

37
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:07,880
Takayama Kazumi.

38
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:11,060
Takayama.

39
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:18,920
First, Takayama Kazumi. Although she was able
 to make Senbatsu this time, she was moved from the Fukujin 8.

40
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:23,240
We've just started and you're instantly called,
 your feelings also must not...

41
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,560
You're not overly...

42
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,100
But this is the second time I've been in this position.

43
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:30,500
Although I was chosen for Fukujin 8 before...

44
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:35,800
I always wondered if I deserved to enter Fukujin 8, but...

45
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:40,680
Maybe I'm positioned in the back 
because I still have many shortcomings.

46
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:45,900
Still, being placed in position 17 of 17 available spots,
 there must be some reason.

47
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:46,420
That's true...
Still, being placed in position 17 of 17 available spots,
 there must be some reason.

48
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:47,220
That's true...

49
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:49,240
Being in the 17th position...

50
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:55,320
My grandmother told me that I was
 in the most vulnerable position, and that surprised me.

51
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:58,000
She also often forgets my position in Senbatsu.

52
00:02:58,340 --> 00:02:58,940
Your position...

53
00:02:58,940 --> 00:02:59,360
She's always said that.
Your position...

54
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,540
She's always said that.

55
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:01,500
I see.

56
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,860
Still, try to stand out more.

57
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:04,100
That's right. I will fight to get back into Fukujin 8.

58
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,500
- Keep working.
That's right. I will fight to get back into Fukujin 8.

59
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,780
That's right. I will fight to get back into Fukujin 8.

60
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,740
Takayama, please stand at the 17th position.

61
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:10,400
Hai. Yoroshiku onegaishimasu.

62
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:15,320
Well, let's continue...

63
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,580
I'll continue the announcement.

64
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:17,540
Number 10.

65
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:21,180
The next member to enter Senbatsu is...

66
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,840
Itou Marika.

67
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,500
Itou Marika...

68
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,980
Has successfully re-entered the Senbatsu.

69
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:38,480
This time, I managed to enter Senbatsu again.

70
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:43,200
In the 7th single, I will continue trying to show my character.

71
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,200
That's right, you're able to make it back in.

72
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,740
Continue to work hard to overcome all challenges.

73
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:50,220
Hai, the 10th position.

74
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:50,660
Dozo.

75
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:52,340
Arigatou gozaimasu.

76
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,320
Okay, let's move on.

77
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,620
Position 16 in the third row.

78
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,920
The next member to enter the Senbatsu is...

79
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:03,920
Kawago Hina.

80
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:24,280
Kawago Hina who always gives warmth to the members
 managed to enter Senbatsu for the first time

81
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:27,580
Well, Kawago.

82
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,500
It's your first time entering Senbatsu.

83
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,820
Hai, this is the first time.

84
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:31,920
How do you feel?

85
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:39,820
All this time, I've always been working in Undergirls, but...

86
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:44,540
This time is the first I've made it into Senbatsu. Ureshii desu.

87
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:51,120
Finally, I can repay the kindness of the fans and my family.

88
00:04:51,120 --> 00:05:00,660
Having been chosen, I will try to throw away my laziness
 and work hard toward making the 7th single.

89
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:04,740
Your grandmother also wondered
 if you were performing on Nogidoko?

90
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:06,700
You answered, "I did not appear."

91
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:11,320
This issue has been discussed before.

92
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:15,280
It seems, I will be featured more in this 7th single.

93
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,440
Hai, I will work hard.

94
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,100
Keep working hard.

95
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:28,880
With this, Kawago enters Senbatsu for the first time,
 but with the entry of Kawago that also means...

96
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:32,420
Well, let's move on.

97
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:34,120
I'll continue the announcement.

98
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,200
Number 11.

99
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,420
The next Senbatsu member is...

100
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,700
Etou Misa.

101
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:57,540
Etou Misa, she also enters the Senbatsu
 for the first time, following Kawago.

102
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,480
How are you feeling now?

103
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:08,920
All this time, I've always been in Undergirls.

104
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:13,000
I've thought, "Is there any reason for me to be in Nogizaka?"

105
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:21,840
But I always think to try my best at every chance I get there.

106
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:28,540
So even though I'm not always chosen for Senbatsu...

107
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:31,560
Because Nogizaka daisuki, I will keep fighting.

108
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,860
I've already made up my resolve.

109
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:37,580
As such, I can't believe I've been chosen.

110
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:39,080
Work hard because you have been chosen.

111
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,080
Ganbarimasu.

112
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:44,500
Hai, that's the 11th position.

113
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,280
Two people have entered Senbatsu for the first time.

114
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:54,140
Let's continue.

115
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:55,620
I'll continue the announcement.

116
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,140
Number 15.

117
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:00,860
The member who will enter the Senbatsu next is...

118
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:03,620
Nakamoto Himeka.

119
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:15,740
Nakamoto Himeka, she also got into Senbatsu for the first time.

120
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,200
How do you feel now?

121
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:28,500
I am also like both of the others,
 doing their best until now as Undergirls in Nogizaka.

122
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,500
Surely...

123
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:36,320
I've wondered if Nogizaka is the right place for me.

124
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:39,360
I'm always thinking of things like that...

125
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:46,140
Although many things are painful. But definitely...

126
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:51,460
I always trust the fans who always support me.

127
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:57,500
I am really grateful for the support they provide.

128
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,960
You've also made it, Himetan.

129
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,780
Hai.

130
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,420
You got in.

131
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:04,060
Hai, omedetou.

132
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:05,260
Arigatou gozaimasu.

133
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:15,520
If Himura-san were here as usual, he would be surprised.
"Lot's of Undergirls are entering Senbatsu."

134
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,160
This is pretty sugoi, isn't it?

135
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:20,720
Three people from Undergirls
 got into Senbatsu for the first time.

136
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:25,020
The 7th single is surprisingly sugoi, right?

137
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:33,680
Of course with the inclusion of Undergirls members, this means
 there will be previous Senbatsu members who have not made it.

138
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,940
Well, let's move on.

139
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:37,380
I'll continue the announcement.

140
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:38,600
Number 12.

141
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:42,740
The next member to enter Senbatsu is...

142
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,700
Saito Asuka.

143
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:57,430
Saito Asuka, she makes it into Senbatsu
 as she did in the 4th single.

144
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:04,580
Because right now I am the most insecure...

145
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:09,600
I will try to work with confidence in this 7th single.

146
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:12,460
Work hard with confidence.

147
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:18,420
There are a lot of members entering Senbatsu
 for the first time, so I feel really relieved.

148
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:20,800
Really, yokatta desu.

149
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:25,360
You must be worried about not being chosen.

150
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:33,220
But you must also be happy to see
 the other members chosen, so you feel conflicted.

151
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:34,160
Yokatta ne.

152
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,100
Ganbarimasu.

153
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,560
Your face is very small.

154
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,940
Omdetou gozaimasu.

155
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:41,280
Arigatou gozaimasu.
 - Hai, the 12th position.

156
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:46,420
This time it's sugoi, there are so many changes.

157
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:49,740
With this, there are four positions
 that changed from the 6th single.

158
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:52,000
Okay, let's move on.

159
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,420
I'll continue the announcement.

160
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,080
Number 14.

161
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,160
The next Senbatsu member is...

162
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:00,820
Fukagawa Mai.

163
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:10,680
Fukagawa Mai, she's made it into Senbatsu for the fifth time.

164
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:16,440
In the 6th single before, I always made
 everything troublesome for the members.

165
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:21,060
Although I still have many shortcomings, still...

166
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:25,860
I will work hard to fix them.

167
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:27,620
Arigatou gozaimasu.
 - Hai.

168
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:29,060
Ganbatte ne.

169
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:34,560
Now is the last position in the third row.

170
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,920
I'll continue the announcement.

171
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:37,600
Number 13.

172
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:41,820
The eighth member to enter Senbatsu is...

173
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:43,840
Akimoto Manatsu.

174
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,020
Akimoto Manatsu, she's always entered
 Senbatsu since returning in the 4th single.

175
00:10:53,020 --> 00:11:01,300
When I returned in the 4th single, I was glad
 for being entrusted once as Fukujin 8.

176
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:08,040
But I moved out of Fukujin 8 during the 6th single.

177
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:13,960
So I've been thinking about working hard
 to get back into Fukujin 8.

178
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:23,660
Though this time I've failed, I'll be more confident
 to try to get back into Fukujin 8 for the next single.

179
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:28,200
It's okay, isn't it? Work to become confident again.

180
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:32,080
I look forward to many interesting reactions from you.

181
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:35,480
Hai. With that, the 13th position. Dozo.

182
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:40,560
Now, the third row is fully occupied.

183
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,240
There are two rows left.

184
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:46,800
After this, more and more surprising things will be announced.

185
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:52,940
Nine positions remain,
 the announcement starts from the second row.

186
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:54,240
I'll continue the announcement.

187
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:55,460
Number 6.

188
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,220
The first person in the second row is...

189
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,520
Sakurai Reika.

190
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:10,720
Sakurai Reika, as captain of the leading members,
 has made it into the Fukujin 8.

191
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:16,840
I am ureshii to be re-entrusted into Fukujin 8.

192
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:23,220
Because this time there are many changes
 and differences that have occurred...

193
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:25,380
With these changes...

194
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:29,680
I will try to push this group to change for the better.

195
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,520
Support them as captain, yes?

196
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:35,140
Ganbarimasu.
 - Hai. Ganbatte kudasai!

197
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:37,400
The 6th position.

198
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:40,460
Well, eight people remain.

199
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:41,680
Let's continue.

200
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,040
I'll continue the announcement.

201
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,320
Number 9.

202
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,160
The next member selected is...

203
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,860
Wakatsuki Yumi.

204
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:58,220
Hai. Wakatsuki.

205
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:05,040
Wakatsuki Yumi, she's made it into
 the Senbatsu Fukujin 8 for the first time.

206
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,040
This is just your first time entering Fukujin 8, right?

207
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,900
How do you feel now?

208
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:15,900
I always try to do well at all the work I receive...

209
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:22,820
In order to be a useful person in Nogizaka.

210
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:25,780
Hai. Omedetou gozaimasu.

211
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:27,240
Yoroshiku onegaishimasu.

212
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,780
The 9th position.

213
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:35,300
Wakatsuki has entered Fukujin 8,
 and there are now seven people left.

214
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,440
Okay, let's move on.

215
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,080
I'll continue the announcement.

216
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:39,900
Number 7.

217
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:43,360
The next member selected is...

218
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,680
Ikuta Erika.

219
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:56,180
Ikuta Erika, though in the second row, she re-enters the Fukujin 8.

220
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:01,130
How are you feeling now?

221
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:10,340
In accordance with my position,
 I will work hard to my best ability.

222
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:15,940
This time there are many changes.

223
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:21,180
Despite the concerns within me...

224
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:25,320
I will work hard with all my body and soul.

225
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,260
Ganbatte, you've been chosen as Fukujin 8.

226
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:29,460
Arigatou gozaimasu. Hai.
 - Please work hard.

227
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:31,140
The 6th position.

228
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:36,320
Six people left, now is the last in the second row.

229
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,820
I'll continue the announcement.

230
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:38,660
Number 8.

231
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,700
The last member in the second row is...

232
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,280
Ikoma Rina.

233
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:54,340
Ikoma Rina who has been a five-time center
 since debut is in the second row this time.

234
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:58,120
Ikoma, how do you feel?

235
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:00,160
Actually, there is a feeling of joy.

236
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:04,100
But even as I say that, it seems that isn't a good thing.

237
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:04,500
Why?
But even as I say that, it seems that isn't a good thing.

238
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:08,920
(Being selected as center) until the 5th single was,
 of course, really very heavy.

239
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,420
Hmm, as the center, yes?

240
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:18,140
Then in the 6th single, I was in a different place
 for the first time. I felt free.

241
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:22,400
It was really fun.

242
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:26,160
Yes, but that's no excuse for not ranking higher, right?

243
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:30,840
Right, now I'm going to do everything with all my strength.

244
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:31,540
I see.

245
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:36,460
With that in mind, I'm not complaining too much about what's there.

246
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:42,620
But I'd rather be able to do something
 with all my might and be happy in that position.

247
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:43,940
- You've matured, haven't you?
But I'd rather be able to do something
 with all my might and be happy in that position.

248
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:44,620
- You've matured, haven't you?

249
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:47,040
You used to hide your face and cry, right?

250
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,500
Yes, I'm always troublesome.

251
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:55,900
No, this position is good for Ikoma
 after what you've said, continue to grow and ganbatte.

252
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:57,120
Ganbarimasu.
 - Hai.

253
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,500
The 8th position.

254
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,840
Well, the five people in the first row remain.

255
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:03,900
Let's continue.

256
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:07,680
Hai, now position 5 on the first row.

257
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:12,180
Finally arriving to the front row members, the first person is...

258
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,000
Matsumura Sayuri.

259
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:22,880
Matsumura Sayuri, she returns as a front row member,
 continuing the previous trend.

260
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:27,260
This time, the formation has changed again.

261
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:30,920
I thought, "Will a new Nogizaka be formed?"

262
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:35,940
I'm looking forward to what Nogizaka will become.

263
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:38,220
You are also a figure who helped push Nogizaka forward.

264
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:39,640
No! No! No!

265
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:42,600
I'm always saying things that aren't necessary.

266
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:46,360
Things like that are also okay, aren't they? Ganbatte kudasai.
- Hai.

267
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,780
Okay, the 5th position.

268
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:52,340
Four people are left.

269
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:53,640
I'll continue the announcement.

270
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:54,900
Number 1.

271
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,800
The next member selected is...

272
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,380
Nishino Nanase.

273
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,540
Nishino.

274
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:10,640
Nishino Nanase, for the first time,
 has gotten a position as a front row member.

275
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:15,980
As it's my first time standing in the front...

276
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:24,420
I'm worried.

277
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:31,920
It seems like there are a lot of people
 who do not think I can rise from the bottom ranks.

278
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:35,240
But no one really thinks like that, right?

279
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:39,880
It makes me very frightened.

280
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:53,440
However, I am ureshii to be once again chosen as Fukujin 8.

281
00:17:53,440 --> 00:18:02,940
Because of that, I want to do my best
 in all these 7th single activities.

282
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:07,620
After this, the center position will finally be determined.

283
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:10,480
Well.

284
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:14,120
Three people are left.

285
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:16,020
I'll continue the announcement.

286
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:18,260
Position 4 of the first row.

287
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,980
The next selected member...

288
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:25,260
Hashimoto Nanami.

289
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:35,120
Hashimoto Nanami, just like Matsumura,
 she returns as a front row member as before.

290
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:42,880
At the 6th single announcement, I was offered various jobs.

291
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:50,940
My feelings when possible were to try
 to be more patient when struggling behind.

292
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:54,000
Then I understood that anything can have a positive impact...

293
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
For both yourself and the people around you.

294
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:02,780
And that makes me happy. Therefore,
 from now on I think I will continue to work hard.

295
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:06,500
From now on various job offers will surely come. Ganbatte.

296
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,360
Hai. do your best.
 - Ganbarimasu.

297
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,080
Hai, the 4th position.

298
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:13,480
Two people are left.

299
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,140
Okay, let's move on.

300
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:17,940
Position 2 in the first row.

301
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,500
The next selected member is...

302
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,080
Shiraishi Mai.

303
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,620
Shiraishi was elected to this position.

304
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:38,670
Shiraishi Mai who was previously trusted as center
 for the first time is a front row member this time.

305
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:41,020
Oh, Shiraishi.

306
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:44,880
Though you have entered Fukujin 8...

307
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,600
That's true.
 - Before, you had the center position.

308
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:51,980
Yes, for the first time I stood as center.

309
00:19:53,900 --> 00:20:00,280
Many things happened to me.

310
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,580
Things that aren't shown also exist.

311
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:08,720
Being in the center position, I had to take on more responsibilities.

312
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:13,660
Although there are many things to think about...

313
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:18,880
Thanks to the support of everyone, I tried my best for the 6th single.

314
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,560
Until now, we've all grown.

315
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:28,860
Everyone wants to be who we are, and now with all our strength we have started to pass our target.

316
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:32,760
Because I was re-elected to the front.

317
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,820
I will put this result aside...

318
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:42,980
And work hard to do a good job alongside everyone.

319
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:45,340
Shiraishi is definitely...

320
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:50,420
Once you become a center, many things
 must be done and other job offers appear.

321
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:53,400
You must have become the face of Nogizaka now.

322
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:57,220
So start working harder now. Ganbatte kudasai.

323
00:20:57,220 --> 00:21:01,240
To the 2nd position.

324
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,740
In this 7th single...

325
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:06,880
The center is neither Ikoma nor Shiraishi.

326
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:11,520
After this, a surprising new center will be unveiled.

327
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:17,380
With this, it's time for the announcement of the new center!

328
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,980
There is one more person remaining, the center of the 7th single.

329
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,500
Please announce it.

330
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:23,440
Number 3.

331
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:28,180
The one chosen as the new center is...

332
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,760
Hori Miona.

333
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:41,500
From there?

334
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:49,220
Hori, please come here.

335
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:02,620
This is sugoi.

336
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:05,300
A member from the Kenkyuusei, yes?

337
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:11,200
She is the 7th single center.

338
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:12,800
How do you feel now?

339
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:20,380
I just entered as a member...

340
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:30,460
I also can't dance like the others...

341
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,160
Because I'm still Kenkyuusei...

342
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:42,280
Such an incredible path...

343
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:48,160
I never once suspected it.

344
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:54,880
You're surprised, aren't you?

345
00:22:55,720 --> 00:23:00,900
Usually, you must feel something when you come here, right?

346
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:05,980
But since you were selected in the 7th single...

347
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,460
Ganbatte!

348
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:12,540
I will work hard with all my might.

349
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:16,300
Arigatou gozaimashita!
- Omedetou gozaimasu!

350
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:21,520
This is very surprising, isn't it?

351
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:27,820
This time, there is a message from management
 regarding the Senbatsu announcement.

352
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:31,920
Well, allow me to read it.

353
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:37,000
To all members of Nogizaka46...

354
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:42,240
You must be surprised by this Senbatsu announcement.

355
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:46,340
Various feelings are mixed in here.

356
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:56,920
But we ask everyone to guide Hori Miona
 the 2nd Gen center who is still very inexperienced.

357
00:23:56,920 --> 00:24:02,720
For the brighter future of Nogizaka46...

358
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:06,760
Nogizaka46 Management.

359
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:10,720
It's true, you have to support each other
 for the future of Nogizaka46.

360
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:14,280
And that's these 17 people, right?

361
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:17,440
The 7th single is really surprising, yes?

362
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,840
Why isn't Himura-san even present?

363
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,860
I think he'll be very surprised.

364
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:26,700
Therefore, with Himura's return next week...

365
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:31,240
We try to get closer to the new 7th single center, Hori Miona.

366
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:38,200
Then, we'll learn the warm feelings of the members
 who have entered the Senbatsu for the first time.

367
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:45,980
Timer: Mukaichi-G  |  Translator: WA Mirakuru, KimKim  |  Typesetter: WA Mirakuru, NiL.  |  TLC & QC: WA Mirakuru, NiL  |  Encoder, Hardsubber, Uploader: NiL | IndoToEng: weeabookstore

368
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:58,840
So can Hori's charm be realized?!
