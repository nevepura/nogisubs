<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Why did you say that?</font>

133
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:11,200
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">I Inoue Sayuri, am her daughter that lives with her, even despite that</font>

134
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:17,260
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">My mother purposely goes to convenience stores, to buy Nogizaka46 trading cards like what a fan would do</font>

135
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:19,130
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">She also would purchase Nogizaka46 official goods</font>

136
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:19,500
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Thats good ain't it?</font>

137
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,290
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Shes kind</font>

138
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:21,380
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Is that sold in stores?</font>

139
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:22,750
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">But I'm the real Inoue Sayuri!</font>

140
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,300
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Yeah, its sold in stores</font>

141
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,000
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Anyone can purchase it from 7-11</font>

142
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,400
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Wow!!</font>

143
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,800
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">My junior spent around 50,000 Yen on the trading cards!</font>

144
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,150
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">EHHH?! Who is this person?</font>

145
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:31,350
<font size="40"><b>{\an5}Core Nogizaka fan</b></font>

146
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:32,760
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">He really collects the trading cards</font>

147
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,400
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Who is this person?</font>

148
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,500
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Then he got obtained a foil card!</font>

149
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,980
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">A FOIL CARD!</font>

150
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">This is awesome! 
 We're so happy!</font>

151
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:40,000
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Thank you!</font>

152
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,200
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Everyone is doing that!</font>

153
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,400
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Its a given for a parent to do that!</font>

154
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,020
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">But that junior of mine is Himetan-oshi</font>

155
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:47,800
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">He was like .. Himetan's card isn't appearing!</font>

156
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:51,500
<font size="40"><b>{\an5}Himetan Oshi</b></font>

157
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:54,200
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">He really likes you a lot!</font>

158
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:54,800
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">EHH ~</font>

159
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,860
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">He really likes you for real</font>

160
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:57,470
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">He got your card after buying so many cards</font>

161
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:57,790
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Ohh ~ thats good to hear!</font>

162
00:06:57,790 --> 00:07:01,280
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">And then he went "HER CARD FINALLY APPEARED ~!"</font>

163
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:06,010
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">That makes you happy right?</font>

164
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:07,170
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Theres still more, here is the next person</font>

165
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:08,830
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">This is still continuing ~</font>

166
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:12,350
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Kawago's mother</font>

167
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:15,310
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">What did Kawago's mother say? Here is her answer!</font>

168
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,600
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">She has good luck in lotteries</font>

169
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,620
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Why did she say this!</font>

170
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,590
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">The topic seems to have been changed a bit</font>

171
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,730
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Kawago you have good luck in drawing lots?</font>

172
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:26,620
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Yes, I have very good luck at that</font>

173
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:29,340
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Kawago, your mother said that instead of saying you're cute or something similar</font>

174
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:32,300
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">"The bottomline is that her lottery luck is good!"</font>

175
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,640
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Did you win something from the lottery before?</font>

176
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:38,640
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">From what we heard from your mother, at a festival you won an oven</font>

177
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:45,450
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Right? Furthermore, on that same day, she participated in a janken competition and won more prizes</font>

178
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,500
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">You have also won before in a magazine's contest</font>

179
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,050
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Yes</font>

180
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:52,600
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">I was thinking of asking her to buy a lottery ticket for me this time</font>

181
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:57,300
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Yes, when my parents buy a lottery ticket, they told me to hold onto it because I have good luck</font>

182
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:59,470
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">And I held onto the ticket even as I slept</font>

183
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:03,580
<font size="40"><b>{\an5}To borrow her luck.</b></font>

184
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:05,660
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">You did that seriously?!</font>

185
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:09,340
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Theres still more! We will move on to the next theme, here it is!</font>

186
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:12,020
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">A member who has changed from when she just joined Nogizaka46</font>

187
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:13,360
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Ahh, I see</font>

188
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,640
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Your parents would be able to tell</font>

189
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:17,000
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Lets start off with the first person, who she is?</font>

190
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,000
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Don't worry you haven't changed</font>

191
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,200
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">From your mother</font>

192
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:23,220
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Her taste buds became 1st class</font>

193
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:25,360
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Why did she say that?!</font>

194
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,190
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">What is this about?</font>

195
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:32,240
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Your mother thinks that you all eat high class snacks or souvenirs frequently</font>

196
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:36,970
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">You lost interest in the snacks at home, you don't even bother about them</font>

197
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,900
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">And next point, this is amazing .. 
 Yes</font>

198
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,260
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Don't say anymore I don't want to hear it!</font>

199
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:43,510
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">She can't stop when shes talking about Yakiniku</font>

200
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:45,290
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">I didn't even talk about that!</font>

201
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:46,940
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">How many grams is this meat's weight?</font>

202
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:47,160
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">UWAHHHHH!!</font>

203
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,880
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">I DIDN'T SAY THAT!!</font>

204
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:53,340
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">This is definitely made up!</font>

205
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:55,400
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Your mother's survey answers certainly did come here</font>

206
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,280
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">I really didn't say that! For real! For real!!</font>

207
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,480
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">I'll definitely call my mother after this studio recording!</font>

208
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,500
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">What you say to her would come back to us</font>

209
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,400
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">It would loop one round and come back here</font>

210
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,160
<font size="40"><b>{\an5}Opposite Effects.</b></font>

211
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,500
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">I won't do it anymore!</font>

212
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:08,080
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Scaryyy! 
 If you complain to your mother, it would just ricochet back and the news would come to us</font>

213
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,610
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">I won't do it!</font>

214
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:14,600
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Lets move on, the next member who has changed since she became an idol is this member!</font>

215
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,210
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Oh Nishino changed?</font>

216
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:18,270
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Here is the reply!</font>

217
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:19,850
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">She now hates sunlight</font>

218
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:20,700
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">What is this about?</font>

219
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:23,720
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">What this about that you now dislike sunlight?</font>

220
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,200
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">What is this about?</font>

221
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,720
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">It sounds sad</font>

222
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,720
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">You're afraid of getting sunburnt right?</font>

223
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:32,970
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">"After she got in Nogizaka, she started to have a strong dislike for the sunlight"</font>

224
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:38,920
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">"When the family travels in car, she will always sit at the rear seat"</font>

225
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:39,820
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Ahh! I see!</font>

226
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,900
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">"She has completely become like an actress"</font>

227
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:48,190
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">That .. I'm not sure about the way your mother phrased it</font>

228
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:51,040
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Because the children always love to sit in the front seat right?</font>

229
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,600
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Yes, I used to always sit in the front seat but</font>

230
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,300
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Because the sun's rays are really strong</font>

231
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,080
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Yeah it really shines through</font>

232
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,910
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">The sun's rays shine onto my legs</font>

233
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:01,040
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Thats why I turned to sitting in the rear seat instead</font>

234
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,560
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">But this is only for summer time</font>

235
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,860
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">I think when winter comes I'll move back to sitting in the front seat</font>

236
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:06,590
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">You'll move back infront?</font>

237
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:07,150
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Yes</font>

238
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,670
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Oh I see</font>

239
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:11,080
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Lets move on, this person is next up</font>

240
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:14,000
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">EHHH?! MY SISTER?! 
 Sister?! Is this for real?!</font>

241
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,170
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Its from your sister</font>

242
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:19,760
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Yes, they are siblings, Saito Chiharu's sister's answers for the survey, here is it!</font>

243
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:21,490
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">She has turned into a tyrant</font>

244
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:29,000
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">This is weird!</font>

245
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,390
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Did you become a tyrant?</font>

246
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:34,440
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">To get an idea of what you did, we have asked your sister and she said this</font>

247
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:37,320
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">She eats the snacks I bought without asking me</font>

248
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:38,160
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Thats not true!</font>

249
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,510
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">When I ask her about it, she tells me "It is mine!"</font>

250
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:48,670
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Again .. we had bought a pair of commuter tickets</font>

251
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:52,400
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">You both had pairing commuter tickets</font>

252
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:56,060
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Chiharu you lost your commuter ticket</font>

253
00:10:56,340 --> 00:11:02,170
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">And then you pointed at your sister's ticket and told her "Thats mine right?"</font>

254
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:03,600
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">This is amazing!</font>

255
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,800
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">"After saying that, she snatches the ticket from me and uses it"</font>

256
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,370
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">And then she broke it</font>

257
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:14,140
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">You're such a tyrant, at the end you even broke it!</font>

258
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:16,520
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">"My sister is such a tyrant at home"</font>

259
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,120
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">Thats not true!</font>

260
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:23,300
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="46">So you treat her stuff as your own, and whats yours is yours. You're a tyrant</font>
