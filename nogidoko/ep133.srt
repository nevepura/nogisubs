00:00:01,550 --> 00:00:06,120
<font size="38">Tonight, we’ll announce the senbatsu members for Nogizaka46’s 9th single.</font>

2
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:09,620
<font size="38">What will happen? And what will the changes be?</font>

3
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:14,730
<font size="38">Nogizaka46 takes a new step towards great leap!</font>

4
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:19,400
<font size="38">Nogizakatte, Doko?</font>

5
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:20,770
<font size="38">DON!</font>

6
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:24,670
<font size="38">Nogizakatte Doko has started, we're your hosts, 
Bananaman, yoroshiku onegaishimasu~</font>

00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:35,610
<font size="38">What do we have for today?</font>

10
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:36,750
<font size="38">Himura-san, please go ahead.</font>

11
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:41,720
<font size="38">Big announcement of the senbatsu members for the 9th single!</font>

12
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:50,630
<font size="38">It felt like the 8th single is not a long ago, 
but we’re already at the 9th single.</font>

13
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:56,240
<font size="38">I mean, it’s simply amazing that we’re already at the 9th single.</font>

14
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,770
<font size="38">It’s so fast.</font>

15
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:01,370
<font size="38">So, how will this turn out?</font>

16
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:03,980
<font size="38">There has been various changes even in Nogizaka, right?</font>

17
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,480
<font size="38">Well, Matsui Rena…</font>

18
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:07,150
<font size="38">-That's right.</font>

19
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:10,680
<font size="38">It has been announced that she’ll be concurrently with SKE,</font>

20
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,790
<font size="38">so there’s a possibility that she can get in the senbatsu, right? 
-That’s right.</font>

21
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:19,660
<font size="38">Ikuta who has announced a hiatus for the 9th single,</font>

22
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:23,200
<font size="38">along with Inoue, whose performance in a stage play overlaps with this recording,</font>

23
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,000
<font size="38">the two of them are absent today.</font>

24
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:30,070
<font size="38">Well then, first, we’ll announce the formation for this single!</font>

25
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,140
<font size="38">This is the formation for the 9th single.</font>

26
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:39,580
<font size="38">Front has five members,</font>

27
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:40,710
<font size="38">Second row also has five members,</font>

28
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:42,450
<font size="38">And the last row has seven?</font>

29
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:43,650
<font size="38">Yes, that is right.</font>

30
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:47,820
<font size="38">And then, the 10 members from the 1st and 2nd row are…</font>

31
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:49,390
<font size="38">the 10-Fukujin.</font>

32
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:51,790
<font size="38">10-Fukujin?</font>

33
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:53,530
<font size="38">Apparently, we have 10-Fukujin everyone.</font>

34
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,860
<font size="38">So this time, 10 people will make for the 10-Fukujin?</font>

35
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,730
<font size="38">There are even a few laughs going on.</font>

36
00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:01,370
<font size="38">10-Fukujin~</font>

37
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:05,170
<font size="38">That’s what it seems this time.</font>

38
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:08,640
<font size="38">Now everyone, finally, we’ll do the announcement.</font>

39
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,710
<font size="38">Okay, lezz go.</font>

40
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:11,510
<font size="38">You said <i>lezz go</i> though.</font>

41
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:12,450
<font size="38">Let's go!</font>

42
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:13,950
<font size="38">Well then, shall we begin?</font>

43
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:15,010
<font size="38">First is…</font>

44
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:15,950
<font size="38">3rd row,</font>

45
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:17,280
<font size="38">#17</font>

46
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:22,090
<font size="38">The first member to enter the senbatsu is…</font>

47
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,160
<font size="38">Takayama Kazumi</font>

48
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:31,160
<font size="38">With her numerous incomprehensible behaviors,</font>

49
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:34,900
<font size="38">Takayama has become an indispensable presence in the show,</font>

50
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:38,200
<font size="38">she made it in the senbatsu this time as well.</font>

51
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:41,070
<font size="38">You’ve been in this spot for quite a lot of times, right?</font>

52
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:43,610
<font size="38">Yes, that’s right. After entering Nogizaka...</font>

53
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:50,620
<font size="38">I’m thankful for always being in that rightmost spot,</font>

54
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:59,260
<font size="38">I’m always in that position so I’m sure there’s a meaning to it.</font>

55
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:02,730
<font size="38">Performing the role of that position,</font>

56
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:07,430
<font size="38">To feel that my existence over there has a meaning,</font>

57
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:09,140
<font size="38">I’d like to do my best.</font>

58
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:11,440
<font size="38">Do your best to have a lot of savings too.</font>

59
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,070
<font size="40"><b>Shitara only knows.</b></font>

60
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:14,410
<font size="38">It’s on the internet, you know.</font>

61
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:17,280
<font size="38">Shitara is shocked by Takayama’s savings.</font>

62
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,150
<font size="38">It appeared right there.</font>

63
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:21,050
<font size="38">I'll work hard.</font>

64
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:22,650
<font size="38">I’ll do my best!</font>

65
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:23,820
<font size="38">Please proceed to the #17 spot.</font>

66
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:26,150
<font size="38">hai, omedetou gozaimasu~</font>

67
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:29,290
<font size="38">That's the first one, there are 16 remaining.</font>

68
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,660
<font size="38">The next member to enter the senbatsu is…</font>

69
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:36,260
<font size="38">Eto Misa</font>

70
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:37,630
<font size="38">Eto?</font>

71
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,200
<font size="38">hai, omedetou~</font>

72
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:47,670
<font size="38">As the oneesan character of Nogizaka, 
Eto has showed her charm even in the show,</font>

73
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:51,410
<font size="38">it has been 2 singles since she last made it in the senbatsu</font>

74
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:56,380
<font size="38">I’m a little surprised,</font>

75
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,780
<font size="38">because I was called too soon.</font>

76
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:01,520
<font size="38">But being in the #11 spot means that…</font>

77
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:04,720
<font size="38">together with Kazumin, we have oneesan at both ends,</font>

78
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:09,260
<font size="38">I’m also thinking that there’s probably a meaning in this position,</font>

79
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:14,070
<font size="38">This time, from this position, I’ll get to see a brand new scenery,</font>

80
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:17,600
<font size="38">so I’d like to do my best as a senbatsu member.</font>

81
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:20,910
<font size="38">Do your best. 
-Yes.</font>

82
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:22,540
<font size="38">omedetou~</font>

83
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:27,550
<font size="38">The two of them have been decided, 15 members left.</font>

84
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:29,680
<font size="38">3rd row,</font>

85
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,420
<font size="38">the next member to enter the senbatsu is…</font>

86
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:34,490
<font size="38">Hori Miona</font>

87
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:38,020
<font size="38">hai, douzo~</font>

88
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,260
<font size="38">She appeared like a comet from the 2nd gen,</font>

89
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:47,270
<font size="38">recently, Hori began to show her mysterious charm even in the show,</font>

90
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:49,840
<font size="38">this time she’s in the 3rd row position.</font>

91
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:53,110
<font size="38">How are you feeling about this?</font>

92
00:04:53,340 --> 00:05:02,380
<font size="38">Well...</font>

93
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:03,880
<font size="38">In the 7th single…</font>

94
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:13,490
<font size="38">In the 7th and 8th single,</font>

95
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:16,300
<font size="38">I was chosen as a senbatsu member,</font>

96
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:21,270
<font size="38">I was even allowed to go up front, however,</font>

97
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:27,970
<font size="38">I wasn’t able to leave any big results.</font>

98
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:35,210
<font size="38">But since the members and the fans have given me so much support,</font>

99
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,550
<font size="38">I’ve been thinking a lot that “thank goodness I entered Nogizaka.”</font>

100
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:43,090
<font size="38">For this single,</font>

101
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,960
<font size="38">I’m next to Takayama-san,</font>

102
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,800
<font size="38">she is very cheerful and funny.</font>

103
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:54,130
<font size="40"><b>Me all of the sudden?</b></font>

104
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:57,200
<font size="38">I’d like to do my best again in this new position.</font>

105
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,970
<font size="38">Thank you very much.</font>

106
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:01,270
<font size="38">Hori is the center in the 7th single,</font>

107
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:03,910
<font size="38">then this time, you’re in the 3rd row so you don’t have to be sad.</font>

108
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:05,340
<font size="38">if you were to take it positively…</font>

109
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:08,610
<font size="38">A group having someone with a center experience in the 3rd row is amazing,</font>

110
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:11,120
<font size="38">someone like that being assigned right here.</font>

111
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,150
<font size="38">Well, Takayama could also teach you a lot of things,</font>

112
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:18,120
<font size="38">Do your best on a positive note. 
-I will.</font>

113
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,330
<font size="38">Thank you very much.</font>

114
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:24,660
<font size="38">It's amazing.</font>

115
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:26,430
<font size="38">Three have been decided.</font>

116
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:28,370
<font size="38">Then, I'll continue with the announcement,</font>

117

<font size="38">Inoue Sayuri</font>

120
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:38,110
<font size="38">Oh, Inoue, she's not here today, right?</font>

121
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:39,780
<font size="38">hai, omedetou~</font>

00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:44,050
<font size="38">Inoue is performing in a play right now right?</font>

123
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:47,050
<font size="38">She’s on stage right now but aren’t we gonna give her a call?</font>

124
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:48,950
<font size="40"><b>Phone call during the play?</b></font>

125
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:53,660
<font size="38">Inoue, whose tears were impressive in the show,</font>

126
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:58,100
<font size="38">her participation in stage plays widens her place of activity.</font>

127
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,170
<font size="38">this time, she made her way back to the senbatsu.</font>

128
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,470
<font size="38">Let’s move on.</font>

129
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:05,600
<font size="38">3rd row, the next senbatsu member is?</font>

130
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:08,310
<font size="38">Yamato Rina</font>

131
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:10,510
<font size="38">There she is!</font>

132
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,320
<font size="38">hai, douzo~</font>

133
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:20,850
<font size="38">While being an under for all 8 previous singles,</font>

134
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:24,690
<font size="38">Yamato lured everyone to smile using her cheerful character in the show,</font>

135
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:28,330
<font size="38">her long-awaited first selection for the senbatsu.</font>

136

-You were finally called.</font>

137
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,760
<font size="38">It’s been a long time since I’ve had my last conversation with you.</font>

138
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,600
<font size="40"><b>Long time no see.</b></font>

139
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,830
<font size="38">What do I do?</font>

140
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:37,540
<font size="38">You were always an under member until now,</font>

141
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,770

00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:47,180
<font size="38">But…</font>

146
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:52,920
<font size="38">I’ve always been an under member, it’s like… I thought I’ve been forgotten.</font>

147
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:56,790
<font size="38">I also think that way.</font>

148
00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:02,030
<font size="38">Still, there are fans who have been supporting me for a long time,</font>

149
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:05,100
<font size="38">they have supported me and never abandoned me.</font>

150
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:09,370
<font size="38">I, myself, this time…</font>

151
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:13,170
<font size="38">At the moment I thought I need to work harder, 
I got this senbatsu announcement.</font>

152
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:14,170
<font size="38">That’s why…</font>

153
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:18,940
<font size="38">I’ll put everything into Nogizaka and do my best.</font>

154
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:23,480
<font size="38">Since this is also a long-awaited selection,</font>

155
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,880
<font size="38">I’m so happy. 
-You never made it in until now,</font>

156
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:30,120
<font size="38">So, drop all those thoughts of “why didn’t I enter the senbatsu?”</font>

157
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,460
<font size="38">I'll do my best.</font>

158
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:32,990
<font size="38">hai, omedetou~</font>

159
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:37,030
<font size="38">Good for you, please go ahead. 
-Thank you very much.</font>

160
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:40,030
<font size="38">This is… her first senbatsu.</font>

161
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
<font size="38">That was cute. 
-That’s true.</font>

162
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:48,540
<font size="38">She made it in her first senbatsu selection.</font>

163
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:51,510
<font size="38">However, all that’s left are 12 spots.</font>

164
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,510
<font size="38">3rd row,</font>

165
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:56,050
<font size="38">The next one who will enter the senbatsu is…</font>

166
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:01,920
<font size="38">Saito Yuuri</font>

167
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,260
<font size="38">Saito Yuuri, omedetou~</font>

168
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:11,860
<font size="38">Saito Yuuri who has always showed her cheerful self in the show,</font>

169
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,700
<font size="38">it has been 3 singles since the last time she made it in the senbatsu.</font>

170
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:18,670
<font size="38">Eh? What should I do?</font>

171
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,210
<font size="38">Simply put… no, not that. Honestly, I’m really happy.</font>

172
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:27,550
<font size="38">I have been working with various under members</font>

173
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:31,750
<font size="38">it’s like.. because I had learned a lot…</font>

174
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:35,620
<font size="38">it would be great if I could show them here.</font>

175
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,620
<font size="38">Eh? Now what? It's been a while.</font>

176
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,890
<font size="38">Good for you! You’re happy, right?</font>

177
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:42,360
<font size="38">I'll do my best.</font>

178
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,800
<font size="38">omedetou! 
-Thank you very much!</font>

179
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,930
<font size="38">Yay!</font>

180
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:56,380
<font size="38">Now, one spot remains for the 3rd row. 
-That’s right.</font>

181
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:58,540
<font size="38">3rd row,</font>

182
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:01,110
<font size="38">the last senbatsu member is…</font>

183
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,580
<font size="38">Hoshino Minami</font>

184
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:12,390
<font size="38">With her carefree appearance,</font>

185
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:14,890
<font size="38">a character loved by the members, Hoshino</font>

186
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:20,130
<font size="38">She's in the senbatsu three singles back, 
will she be able to show her growth since then?</font>

187
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:23,500
<font size="38">It’s been a while. 
-It’s been a while.</font>

188
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,500
<font size="38">What are you feeling right now?</font>

189
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:28,670
<font size="38">Until now,</font>

190
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:32,780
<font size="38">I’ve been given a great chance at the beginning, 
with being a 7-Fukujin and such.</font>

191
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:37,420
<font size="38">But, what’s that? there’s that half-hearted feeling... 
So the chance slipped out.</font>

192
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:41,950
<font size="38">Because I got chosen this time, I’d like to give it all I’ve got.</font>

193
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:43,320
<font size="38">Ah, I see...</font>

194
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:45,790
<font size="38">Fill up the questionnaire provided by the show, okay?</font>

195
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,260
<font size="38">We’re counting on you. 
-I’ll fill them all out.</font>

196
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:48,760
<font size="40"><b>Declaration of filling everything out.</b></font>

197
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,730
<font size="38">You said it, we’re counting on that.</font>

198
00:10:51,100 --> 00:11:01,510
<font size="38">Well then, please do your best. 
-hai, omedetou~</font>

199
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:04,180
<font size="38">After this, the announcements for the 10-Fukujin!</font>

200
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:06,610
<font size="38">10-Fukujin right?</font>

201
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:09,550
<font size="38">Yes, from this point onwards, it will be the 10-Fukujin.</font>

202
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:11,480
<font size="38">10-Fukujin,</font>

203
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,450
<font size="38">the first one who will be selected is?</font>

204
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,120
<font size="38">Wakatsuki Yumi</font>

205
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,190
<font size="38">omedetou~</font>

206
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:27,330
<font size="38">Wakatsuki who has an impressive motor nerve 
and has an all-out effort image all the time,</font>

207
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:31,570
<font size="38">as a 10-Fukujin this time, what kind of image will she show?</font>

208
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:34,910
<font size="38">I'll be turning 20 this June.</font>

209
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:40,280
<font size="38">Before that, I was allowed to be in the #6 spot this time.</font>

210
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,380
<font size="38">I’m very thankful for that.</font>

211
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:45,650
<font size="38">I’m filled with feelings of “I have to really do my best.”</font>

212
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,520
<font size="38">The goal is only thing that is high,</font>

213
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:53,130
<font size="38">so that I could be more satisfied with myself, I’ll do my best.</font>

214
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:54,860
<font size="38">You’re turning 20 already. 
-Yes.</font>

215
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:57,700
<font size="38">Then, we’ll look forward to your growth.</font>

216
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:58,360
<font size="38">Yes.</font>

217
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,700
<font size="38">yoroshiku onegaishimasu 
-omedetou gozaimasu~</font>

218
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:04,100
<font size="38">10-Fukujin, one spot has been decided.</font>

219
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:06,710
<font size="38">There are 9 remaining. 
-Yes.</font>

220
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:11,640
<font size="38">The next one to be selected in the 10-Fukujin is…</font>

221
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,650
<font size="38">Ikoma Rina</font>

222
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,290
<font size="38">She’s leading Nogizaka with her angelic character, Ikoma,</font>

223
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:25,290
<font size="38">the experience she gained from her concurrency with AKB,</font>

224
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:27,790
<font size="38">can she demonstrate that in Nogizaka this time?</font>

225
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,300
<font size="38">This time, you’re in the 10-Fukujin.</font>

226
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,970
<font size="38">My goal this year is to acquire a craft or special skill,</font>

227
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:39,200
<font size="38">I’m thinking of acquiring skills as my own weapon.</font>

228
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,710
<font size="38">The concurrency as well.</font>

229
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:49,380
<font size="38">In Nogizaka46 alone, I think there are a lot of things where I could grow, but,</font>

230
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:54,820
<font size="38">by adding some uneasiness like, “I wonder if I can do this on my own?”</font>

231
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:57,760
<font size="38">I’ll set myself in motion.</font>

232
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,930
<font size="38">In this one year as a kennin, with the thinking of wanting to develop immediately,</font>

233
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:03,600
<font size="38">I'd like to give it my best.</font>

234
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,870
<font size="38">We were surprised by your concurrent position in AKB, then you’re even participating in the general election.</font>

235
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:07,230
<font size="38">Yes.</font>

236
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:10,770
<font size="38">But this is all for Nogizaka's sake, right? 
-That's true.</font>

237
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:14,540
<font size="38">Well, I’m the one responsible for it,</font>

238
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,880
<font size="38">but I want to elevate Nogizaka46.</font>

239
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:24,180
<font size="38">I really wanted to extend the fun and happy things to these members,</font>

240
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:26,850
<font size="38">and I want to know more about them.</font>

241
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:28,890
<font size="38">Do your best. 
-I'll do my best.</font>

242
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:30,420
<font size="38">omedetou~</font>

243
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:36,030
<font size="38">Three spots remaining for the 2nd row.</font>

244
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:41,200
<font size="38">Eight spots remaining, the next 10-Fukujin is…</font>

245
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,030
<font size="38">Akimoto Manatsu</font>

246
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,470
<font size="38">hai, Akimoto~</font>

247
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:56,310
<font size="38">Akimoto’s presence in the show gets bigger after she started her reaction skills,</font>

248
00:13:56,310 --> 00:14:01,020
<font size="38">with her black-hearted character, can she amass new wisdom and courage?</font>

249
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:04,520
<font size="38">I came back during the 4th single,</font>

250
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:07,730
<font size="38">I was allowed to be in the 8-Fukujin for two singles, but…</font>

251
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:11,600
<font size="38">after that, I dropped in the 3rd row.</font>

252
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:16,100
<font size="38">From here, in order to go up front, I have to exert effort.</font>

253
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:18,470
<font size="38">I’ve always wanted to be up front.</font>

254
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:20,940
<font size="38">I was given this position but…</font>

255
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:26,240
<font size="38">I won’t lack any effort, I’ll thank the fans and I will work hard.</font>

256
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:31,480
<font size="38">That’s how you honestly feels right? 
You have those feelings of wanting to go up front.</font>

257
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:34,120
<font size="38">The time I get in front,</font>

258
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:37,860
<font size="38">I will still keep on showing my thighs and shoulders.</font>

259
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:39,090
<font size="38">With that, I’ll do my best.</font>

260
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:40,330
<font size="38">It’s alright. You could go to another trial.</font>

261
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:41,830
<font size="40"><b>Oath of exposure.</b></font>

262
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:44,000
<font size="38">Do your best. 
-Yes, I will.</font>

263
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,100
<font size="38">hai, omedetou gozaimasu~ 
-Thank you very much</font>

264
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:50,400
<font size="38">Now, two spots left for the 2nd row.</font>

265
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:54,310
<font size="38">The next one to be selected as a 10-Fukujin is…</font>

266
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:57,210
<font size="38">Fukagawa Mai</font>

267
00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:00,050
<font size="38">hai, Fukagawa, omedetou~</font>

268
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,720
<font size="38">As Nogizaka’s healing oneesan,</font>

269
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,190
<font size="38">Fukagawa gives tranquility to the members,</font>

270
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:11,420
<font size="38">with her dearest wish of getting in the 10-Fukujin, a new start has come!</font>

271
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:14,430
<font size="38">The number of people has changed again this time.</font>

272
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:19,160
<font size="38">This is my first time being selected in that area of the Fukujin.</font>

273
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:23,500
<font size="38">The fans are like… coming from those fans from the very beginning…</font>

274
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:27,510
<font size="38">”Do your best so that you’ll be selected someday.”</font>

275
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:32,410
<font size="38">I’m very happy that I can finally repay them a little.</font>

276
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:37,150
<font size="38">This position in the 9th single, 
is this a chance for something great?</font>

277
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:38,650
<font size="38">I'll do my best. 
-Do your best.</font>

278
00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:39,990
<font size="38">Thank you very much.</font>

279
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,920
<font size="38">omedetou~</font>

280
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:47,090
<font size="38">Fukagawa made it in, all that remains is the one at the middle.</font>

281
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:51,260
<font size="38">The last 10-Fukujin in the 2nd row is…</font>

282
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:53,630
<font size="38">Sakurai Reika</font>

283
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:57,170
<font size="38">hai, omedetou~</font>

284
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:04,010
<font size="38">As Nogizaka’s immovable captain, Sakurai has been pushing forward while bearing that heavy pressure,</font>

285
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:08,510
<font size="38">by being a 10-Fukujin this time, can she make further progress?</font>

286
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:12,480
<font size="38">This position is not… 
-This is my first time here.</font>

287
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,390
<font size="38">I've always been in the #6 spot. 
-Is that so?</font>

288
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:16,120
<font size="38">That's right.</font>

289
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:19,590
<font size="38">Last time, during the announcement,</font>

290
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:22,860
<font size="38">I've said something negative.</font>

291
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:29,570
<font size="38">However, at handshake events, the fans who saw it...</font>

292
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:34,440
<font size="38">they said something like “That’s not true!” 
and that made me really happy.</font>

293
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:40,750
<font size="38">Without saying anything negative like that, I have to try harder.</font>

294
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:45,250
<font size="38">It would be great if I could return the favor with this single.</font>

295
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:47,090
<font size="38">hai, omedetou gazaimasu~</font>

296
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:53,560
<font size="38">We’re already at the front, five spots remaining.</font>

297
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:57,400
<font size="38">Now, let's get to the first row.</font>

298
00:16:58,530 --> 00:17:02,170
<font size="38">Finally, the 1st row, who will be called first?</font>

299
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,070
<font size="38">Matsumura Sayuri</font>

300
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:13,280
<font size="38">Matsumura, a well-known gluttonous character in the show,</font>

301
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:19,480
<font size="38">this time she made her way back to the 1st row, we expect her to bring out even more charm.</font>

302
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:25,720
<font size="38">I'm really happy but... really, it's like...</font>

303
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:30,260
<font size="38">It’s like, I’m happy that I got in, but…</font>

304
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:35,770
<font size="38">of course there’s a lot of frustrations. 
-I get it.</font>

305
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:40,270
<font size="38">This will be a long story so I won’t say it, but,</font>

306
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:42,910
<font size="38">Himura-san, do you like me?</font>

307
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:43,340
<font size="40"><b>What's gotten into you?</b></font>

308
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:44,710
<font size="38">What do you mean by that?</font>

309
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:47,380
<font size="38">I do, I like all of you. 
-Right?</font>

310
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:48,910
<font size="38">-Do you like me back?</font>

311
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:50,380
<font size="38">Shitara-san, do you like Nogizaka46?</font>

312
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:52,050
<font size="38">I do.</font>

313
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:54,950
<font size="38">Then I will work hard with everyone in Nogizaka!</font>

314
00:17:56,120 --> 00:18:01,160
<font size="38">Well then, please go ahead. 
-Do your best.</font>

315
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:03,530
<font size="38">There are four spots remaining. onegaishimasu~</font>

316
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:07,700
<font size="38">The next member who'll make it into the first row is...</font>

317
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:10,900
<font size="38">Matsui Rena</font>

318
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,010
<font size="38">Matsui Rena-san</font>

319
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:18,110
<font size="38">Concurrently with SKE48, Matsui Rena,</font>

320
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:21,250
<font size="38">this time, she suddenly entered the senbatsu as a 10-Fukujin.</font>

321
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:24,450
<font size="38">What kind of fusion will she show with Nogizaka?</font>

322
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,420
<font size="38">So Matsui Rena-san goes right here? 
-Yes.</font>

323
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:30,820
<font size="38">Now, we’re down to three.</font>

324
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:34,460
<font size="38">The next name that will be called is…</font>

325
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:37,800
<font size="38">Hashimoto Nanami</font>

326
00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:47,640
<font size="38">Hashimoto made an appearance in a golden hour drama, 
playing an active part in various genre,</font>

327
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:52,340
<font size="38">we’re looking forward to the further progress of that sadistic character?</font>

328
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,510
<font size="38">I cut my hair…</font>

329
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,620
<font size="38">That’s right.</font>

330
00:18:58,620 --> 00:18:59,650
<font size="38">You cut your hair. It became shorter.</font>

331
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:02,420
<font size="40"><b>Ordinary report?</b></font>

332
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:03,760
<font size="38">It became shorter.</font>

333
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:07,790
<font size="38">I entered Nogizaka when I was 18,</font>

334
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:09,990
<font size="38">It has been three years…</font>

335
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:14,330
<font size="38">it is said that the 3rd year is a turning point.</font>

336
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:21,840
<font size="38">I think maybe this 9th single is also going to be a turning point for me…</font>

337
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,110
<font size="38">in various ways.</font>

338
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:28,980
<font size="38">It would be nice if we could make a good one.</font>

339
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:33,120
<font size="38">For the 9th single, what kind of a new Hashimoto will emerge?</font>

340
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,120
<font size="38">Please do your best, okay?</font>

341
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,050
<font size="38">Thank you very much.</font>

342
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:42,960
<font size="38">After this, finally, the center will be determined!</font>

343
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:46,060
<font size="38">Just two remaining? 
-We’re down to two.</font>

344
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:49,400
<font size="38">The next one will be the #2 position. 
-We’ve come to this.</font>

345
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,670
<font size="38">Two spots remaining, the first one who will be called is?</font>

346
00:19:55,710 --> 00:20:02,380
<font size="38">Shiraishi Mai</font>

347
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:06,350
<font size="38">So far, Shiraishi had shown various expressions in the show,</font>

348
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:11,860
<font size="38">including her new character called Kuroishi-san, we expect to see even greater activity.</font>

349
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:15,130
<font size="38">Rena-san joined us this time.</font>

350
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:18,860
<font size="38">With this brand new look…</font>

351
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:21,530
<font size="38">I’m wondering how it will turn out but…</font>

352
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:26,200
<font size="38">In order to make a better single than what we have so far, together…</font>

353
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:31,180
<font size="38">I think it would be nice if we could put our strengths together and do our best.</font>

354
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:37,220
<font size="38">That goes for everyone, wondering how this will turn out, 
then there are also a lot of worries, right?</font>

355
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:39,420
<font size="38">You have to deliver something good if you’re going to do it.</font>

356
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:40,420
<font size="38">Please do your best.</font>

357
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:41,590
<font size="38">I'll do my best.</font>

358
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:43,150
<font size="38">omedetou gozaimasu~</font>

359
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:49,730
<font size="38">All that’s left is just one spot, the center.</font>

360
00:20:51,560 --> 00:21:01,610
<font size="38">Nogizaka46 9th single’s center is…</font>

361
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:03,270
<font size="38">Nishino Nanase</font>

362
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:10,880
<font size="38">Despite being mild-mannered in character,</font>

363
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:15,020
<font size="38">With the strength hidden within herself, Nishino has gone beyond many walls,</font>

364
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:18,420
<font size="38">Center for two consecutive singles.</font>

365
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:23,700
<font size="38">It’s like… uhmm…</font>

366
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:29,730
<font size="38">I never really thought that I’d be center for the second time.</font>

367
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:33,340
<font size="38">The activities in the 8th single…</font>

368
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:42,810
<font size="38">(Being the center) I thought it was just a one-shot.</font>

369
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:45,220
<font size="38">When I feel really anxious,</font>

370
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:51,460
<font size="38">The members around me, my family and the fans supported me.</font>

371
00:21:53,390 --> 00:21:56,790
<font size="38">I managed to get through it somehow.</font>

372
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:05,840
<font size="38">Personally, I was able to do all of the 8th single activities without any regrets.</font>

373
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:10,310
<font size="38">Being the center for the next single too…</font>

374
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:17,220
<font size="38">that was the most frightening.</font>

375
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:28,460
<font size="38">When one became a center for the second time,</font>

376
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:34,670
<font size="38">the way the fans observe, won’t it be strict?</font>

377
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,630
<font size="38">I’m really scared.</font>

378
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:43,040
<font size="38">Everytime, right here, Nishino’s words are always pessimistic..</font>

379
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:45,680
<font size="38">You are scared.</font>

380
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:50,350
<font size="38">but those around you will support you again. You’re not doing this on your own.</font>

381
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:52,480
<font size="38">In the 8th single, you did a lot.</font>

382
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:57,460
<font size="38">Since you were chosen as center, the attention you received increased too. You also did the bungee.</font>

383
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:02,060
<font size="38">With confidence, do your best in the 9th single as well.</font>

384
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:03,630
<font size="38">I will.</font>

385
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,430
<font size="38">I’m nervous…</font>

386
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,130
<font size="38">I’m nervous~</font>

387
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:14,610
<font size="38">9th single senbatsu members are determined!</font>

388
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:19,540
<font size="38">Inoue who was absent from the recording today,</font>

389
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:21,550
<font size="38">in order to inform her about making it in the senbatsu,</font>

390
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:24,780
<font size="38">we go straight to the dressing room after her performance.</font>

391
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:27,590
<font size="38">Eh?!</font>

392
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:30,720
<font size="38">Wait a minute… right now…</font>

393
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,930
<font size="38">I was going to take off my costume. I took it off partway.</font>

394
00:23:33,930 --> 00:23:35,430
<font size="38">I got surprised. What’s this?</font>

395
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:38,060
<font size="38">I hate it. If this is a prank, no way…</font>

396
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,200
<font size="38">What is it?</font>

397
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:47,440
<font size="38">You made it in the senbatsu. 
-Thank goodness!</font>

398
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:54,250
<font size="38">I made it! Thank goodness!</font>

399
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:58,080
<font size="38">Since there are a lot of things I learned in Under,</font>

400
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:02,320
<font size="38">so that I could make the best out of it, I’ll give it my all.</font>

401
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:07,230
<font size="38">And then, Matsui Rena also expressed her feelings about making it in the senbatsu.</font>

402
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:10,530
<font size="38">Because I was able to get in as a senbatsu member,</font>

403
00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:13,160
<font size="38">that part, of course… as a Nogizaka member,</font>

404
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:16,170
<font size="38">I want to do my best.</font>

405
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:20,810
<font size="38">In NogiDoko, they always do a project that seems to be a hit prayer right?</font>

406
00:24:20,810 --> 00:24:24,140
<font size="38">Getting pounded by a waterfall, then recently, doing a bungee jump.</font>

407
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:26,840
<font size="38">I think everyone seems to be having fun.</font>

408
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:29,380
<font size="38">I thought I wanted to do that.</font>

409
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:36,850
<font size="38">Because I became a Nogizaka, even if I have to work hard to the bone, I hope I could participate in it.</font>
