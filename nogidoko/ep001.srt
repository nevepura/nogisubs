1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,480
Located in the south of Tokyo, Nogizaka.

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:08,520
Many people come here for pursuing their dream to become a star.

3
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:15,390
And the idol group that pursuing their dream now is AKB48 official rival, Nogizaka46.

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:27,310
August 21th 2011, audition all over Japan held.
There were 38,934 applicants, 36 people chosen, and now has 33 people.

5
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:32,040
Then, Nogizaka46 itself, what kind of idol group they actually are?

6
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:37,550
And how is their concept? Producer Akimoto Yasushi speak directly.

7
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:45,260
The concept of Nogizaka46 is "No Concept".

8
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:53,800
The difference is, let's say in AKB48 there is an election and janken tournament one times a year.

9
00:00:53,800 --> 00:01:04,940
But in Nogizaka46, the members change will be faster based on fan's votes right at the moment.

10
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:12,620
That means, the 5 years journey of AKB48 in the last 5 years must be approached by Nogizaka46 in only 5 months.

11
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:21,060
So thats why, hard training is their everyday menu.

12
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:25,260
In a very short time, there will be member changes etc.

13
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:35,980
It has just begin, but they already have a new test.
From 33 members, 15 will be choosen as senbatsu member.

14
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:43,150
From the lesson result, also from the fans comment in the official site, Nogizaka46's staff choosing the senbatsu.

15
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:48,650
Then, who will success this time?

16
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:54,460
- Shiraishi Mai.
- Yes.

17
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:58,630
The first choosen is 19 years old Shiraishi Mai.

18
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,830
- Ikuta Erika.
- Yes.

19
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,710
And next, 14 years old Ikuta Erika.

20
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:12,910
Then, 17 years old Sakurai Reika.

21
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:16,580
- Takayama Kazumi.
- Yes.

22
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:21,490
The fourth, also 17 years old, Takayama Kazumi.

23
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:29,560
And next, all choosen member got their name called one by one.

24
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:36,170
For them, senbatsu member is their first test.

25
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:42,710
After formed, they must do a hard practice everyday to become senbatsu member.

26
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:52,380
And because their hardwork has paid off, now they all cried happily.

27
00:02:53,150 --> 00:03:01,990
- Last person is..
- And finally, the last choosen member name will be called, they all look nervous.

28
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:05,100
Ikoma Rina.

29
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,900
And the last choosen member is 15 years old Ikoma Rina.

30
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:19,010
Tears of joy arises, and they express their happiness to each other for being choosen as senbatsu member.

31
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:25,080
For them, this is a very happy moment.

32
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:39,970
And for those who were not chosen, the battle has just begin, there are still a lot of chances for them to replace the current choosen member.

So it's Ungirls..

44
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,440
- Why, you have a problem?
- Yes.

45
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:55,410
Your face makes me want to puke.

46
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:57,780
1 human, 3 monsters.

47
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:04,020
And now we gonna ask the Ungirls, who's their AKB48 oshimen?

48
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:10,990
- Do you have one?
- Me..Um..Mayuyu and Yukirin..Ah I slip my tongue.

49
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:19,230
- Because black hair is pretty.
- So you like black hair.

50
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:23,400
- Because you're a thin haired skinny guy.
- Hey what's your problem!?

51
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,410
- Himura also have one.
- Me, Oshima Yuko..

52
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:31,110
I even bought Yuko's photobook.

53
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:38,420
He said he have his favourite part (in the photobook). If he likes something,
he'll always impersonating it.

54
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:43,690
The one where she peek from the pipe, and come out to the outside.

55
00:05:43,690 --> 00:06:02,680
- You don't have to say it, have you ever seen a photobook where the person come out from the pipe?
- Basically, in that part.. Let's practice it.

56
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,310
So bad..

57
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:07,480
Official rival (AKB48)

58
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:14,150
Official rival? Wait we still don't know anything, did they have their own theater like AKB48 too?

59
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:18,490
Well, there is no theater.

60
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:25,430
Ee..Nogizaka46 doesn't have a theater..

61
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:32,170
AKB have one..their sister group also have..

62
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:34,970
They all have their own theater.

63
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:40,380
And when you think Nogizaka46 have a theater,
that's a big mistake! There isn't!

64
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:45,450
So they are "Idol that you can't meet".

65
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:48,090
- Why?
- There is no other way.

66
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:51,490
What is the reason?

67
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:55,990
So they're not the idol that depend on the theater.

68
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:04,070
After this Nogizaka46 members will show up. Please take a look at these fully talented members.
