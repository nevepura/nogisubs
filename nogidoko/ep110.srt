00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:05,000
Nogizaka46 7th single campaign

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Eh? You’re going here?

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,100
This time, all members are going to various waterfalls over the country to do a hit prayer.

4
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:19,500
And then, a shocking development for the members?!

5
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,500
You’re kidding, right?

00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,300

-Yoroshiku Onegeshimasu

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,300
and they are...
 Nogizaka-chan~

12
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:01,600
Finally, on the 27th of November, 
the long awaited 7th single “Barette” is on sale!

13
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,200
That being said, this time…

14
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,500
During the time of release of a new single, 

15
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,700
this show always do a campaign.

16
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:09,700
Established tradition

17
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:12,000
You’ve done a lot of things in the past, right?

18
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:17,500
In the past, the members have done various harsh campaigns 
such as sky diving, waterfall and bungee jumping.

19
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:20,700
What are the details for this campaign?

20
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,000
This is what you’ll do this time… 

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,700
Jan!

22
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:24,400
Waterfall

23
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,400
Again?

24
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,000
Again?

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,500
Is this a joke?

26
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,500
We’ve done that before!

27
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:35,400
Here’s the catch, this time...

28
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,600
All 17 members will be pounded by the waterfall.

29
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,300
All of them.

30
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:43,300
What is it? What is it?

31
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:44,300
What’s up with all of you?

32
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,700
Hori, is it alright with you?

33
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,700
She don’t know anything about it, right? 
-About what?

34
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:50,200
She don’t know about the waterfall era…

35
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,700
Waterfall era?

36
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:55,200
That’s right, Nogizaka is significantly divided by it, right?

37
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,100
there’s time prior to the waterfall era and waterfall era up to the present.

38
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:58,800
Mysterious waterfall standard

39
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,500
Why are you dividing it with the waterfall?

40
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,300
Take a look at the four teams,

41
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:07,400
Each team will go to a waterfall singled out from all over the country.

42
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:12,600
Then, the four waterfalls that caught our attention are..

43
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,100
Gunma’s waterfall

44
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:18,100
Here’s the next one.

45
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:21,100
Kanagawa’s waterfall

46
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,100
Next,

47
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:25,100
Okinawa’s waterfall

48
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:27,300
Pleasant waterfall?

49
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:35,200
and last

50
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,200
Iwate’s waterfall

51
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,200
It’s cold.

52
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,000
Here are the details regarding the four waterfalls.

53
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,400
<font color="#fd5b5a">Average temperature 
<font color="#5a61fd">Average water temperature</font></font>

54
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,700
Iwate has the harshest temperatures,

55
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:48,300
and of course, Okinawa has the warmest.

56
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:51,000
Who wants to go to Okinawa?

57
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,100
I do!

58
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:53,500
Natural outcome

59
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,200
Who wants to go to Iwate?

60
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:01,400
That’s odd.

61
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:06,400
To be fair, draw lots will determine which waterfall the teams will go to.

62
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:10,700
First up is “NO” team, which waterfall will they get?

63
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:12,400
Right here!

64
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,100
Gunma!

65
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,200
Okay, you’ll go to Gunma.

66
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,300
The end.

67
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:28,200
Next, “GI” team’s destination is?

68
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,200
Okinawa

69
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,900
Okinawa appeared!

70
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,900
It appeared, huh?

71
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:39,700
Please go to Okinawa.

72
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:41,200
Fresh team! No doubt.

73
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,400
The ones remaining are Kanagawa and Iwate falls,

74
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,800
Which one will the “ZA” team get?

75
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,800
Green team,

76
00:03:49,800 --> 00:04:02,900
Iwate!

77
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:05,200
Magnificent!

78
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,700
With that, the waterfall assigned to “KA” team is determined.

79
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:13,700
Will they be able to do a safe hit prayer?

80
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:22,500
Today, we arrived at Daijouin, Odawara City, Kanagawa Prefecture.

81
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,300
We have a bit of a sad news…

82
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:31,700
One of our members, Ikuta Erika,

83
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:35,700
fractured her pinky toe a few days ago.

84
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:36,200
Because she can’t do the waterfall,

85
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,200
Serious Injury

86
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,400
she’s not here today.

87
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:46,800
Ikuta is out because of a fractured pinky toe, 
a disappointing way to retire from the campaign.

88
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,000
What caused this frightening accident?

89
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,700
How did it happen?

90
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,600
Detergent! 
Yes.

91
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,600
A brand new bottle of detergent fell on her toe, right?

92
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:03,000
While hurrying in the morning, the bottle detergent goes “BO!” then her pinky toe goes “KA!”

93
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,700
<font size="9">Hashimoto enjoys others’ 
misfortune, huh?</font>

94
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,200
It was terrible right? 
-I’m surprised by it.

95
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:09,200
<font size="10">Fracture because of bottled detergent? 
Can that really happen?</font>

96
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:15,500
Let’s all do our best together and fill in Ikuchan’s share!

97
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:22,300
And here to guide them is Daijouin’s head priest, En Junkou-san

98
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,100
and his deputy, En Komyou-san

99
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:28,600
This ritual is also called “Goma daki”

100
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:35,200
Before going to the waterfall, first they have to do the ritual of writing 
their wish on a piece of wood and throw it into the fire and pray.

101
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:42,700
Everyone wished for the 7th single “Barrette” to be a big hit,

102
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:45,700
then they put the firewood containing their wish into the fire.

103
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:51,000
After the ritual, finally they’re headed to the waterfall.

104
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,100
What kind of waterfall will “KA” team face?

105
00:05:54,900 --> 00:06:00,300
Today, the water volume is twice more than usual.

106
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:04,100
You are all going up there.

107
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,300
You’re going in there.

108
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,500
You’re going in this waterfall.

109
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:13,200
This is the Takigou waterfall.

110
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:17,400
With the water falling from a height of 12 meters, 
it will echo even within the body’s core.

111
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:21,200
It will relentlessly drain the stamina of those who will try this.

112
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,500
Desperation, become serious, make an effort towards austerity.

113
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,000
Do you understand? 
Yes!

114
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,100
Takigou falls that almost no one can go into,

115
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:36,100
going forward on a road without tracks,

116
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,000
climbing with the use of ladder.

117
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,700
<font size="9">This is quite impressive</font>

118
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:45,700
According to the head priest, the waterfall have to be purified first.

119
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:52,400
The four members are overwhelmed by the force of the waterfall.

120
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:58,000
Before going to the waterfall, the deputy head priest 
teach them the way of praying.

121
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:03,000
When you pray, you say your wishes and then say “BORON” (fulfillment)

122
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Then face the waterfall,

123
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,000
and then say thank you.

124
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,200
Speak loudly.

125
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,800
Nanamin, do your best!

126
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,600
Start praying!

127
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,800
Do your best~

128
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:46,100
Praying for the 7th single, Barrette, to be a big hit!

129
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:48,600
Sing up!

130
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:57,300
By the window in the library, female students whisper, conspiring~

131
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:01,800
The prayer! The prayer!

132
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,000
Praying for the 7th single, Barrette, to be a big hit!

133
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
and for a stronger body!

134
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Boron!!

135
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Boron!!
Boron!!

136
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,500
Boron!!
Boron!!

137
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:15,700
Boron! 


138
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:18,800
Thank you very much!

139
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,400
Thank you very much!

140
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,000
You did great.

141
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,800
Go right there.

142
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,400
Endure it, do your best!

143
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:42,500
Praying for the 7th single, Barrette, to be a big hit!

144
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,600
<font size="9">That’s nice, 
When you see them like this,</font>

145
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,300
<font size="9">It makes you want 
to support them.</font>

146
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:50,300
By chance, our eyes met as if you peeked into my heart.

147
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:56,800
I already raised the white flag.

148
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:03,700
Praying for the 7th single to be a big hit!

149
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,600
Boron~

150
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,700
Boron~!!!

151
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,300
Boron

152
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,300
Boron~!!

153
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,500


154
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,300
Thank you very much!

155
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:18,300
Thank you very much!

156
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:20,300
Thank you very much!

157
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:25,300
<font size="9"></font>

158
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,700
Go a little bit further.

159
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,600
<font size="9"></font>

160
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,000
Right here, right here.

161
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,400
Praying for Nogizaka46’s 7th single, Barrette, to become a big hit!

162
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:52,200
By the window in the library, female students whisper, conspiring~

163
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,000
Praying for “Barrette” to become a big hit!

164
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,500
and for everyone’s health and happiness!

165
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Yoroshiku onegaishimasu~

166
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,100
Boron~!!!

167
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,100
-One more time! 
-Boron~!!

168
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:05,100
Boron~!

169
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,200
Thank you very much! 
-Thank you very much!

170
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,800
Please go ahead.

171
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:24,900
Praying for the 7th single, Barrette, to be a big hit!

172
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,900
<font size="10">Suddenly the water volume 
seems to amped up.</font>

173
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:43,100
While reading Hemmingway, 
female students whisper, conspiring..

174
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,800
Eh? Aren’t the lyrics different?  
-Reika’s lyrics are different!

175
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,700
In the midst of panic.

176
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:50,700
Boron~!

177
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,500
Boron~!

178
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:55,100


179
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:07,700
Thank you very much!

180
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:12,800
At the end, to wish for a hit, everyone sang “Barrette”

181
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:19,600
<font size="9">Hashimoto’s shaking.</font>

182
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:24,500
<font size="9">It seems you want to 
wrap it up quickly.</font>

183
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,300
Big hit!

184
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:29,100
Thank you very much! 

185
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,900
Okay, go here.

186
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:33,200
<font size="9">He went right in!</font>

187
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,300
<font size="9">He went to the waterfalls.</font>

188
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:38,200
Praying for the 7th single, Barrette, to become a big hit!

189
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,200
Boron~!!!!

190
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,200
Boron~!

191
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:46,700
Thank you very much!

192
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:54,100
Well done.

193
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:56,100
Boron~!!
Boron~!!

194
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,900
Good for you.

195
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,500
Ikuta is not here today too.

196
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,600
Why? 
What’s the matter?

197
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,200
Fracture… 
-Pinky toe…

198
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:07,000
Hashimoto really likes others’ misfortune,

199
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,100
Can’t stop laughing

200
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:11,500
Hashimoto, how did it happened again?

201
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:16,300
A brand new bottle of detergent dropped on her toe, fracturing it.

202
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:18,300
She just keeps on laughing.

203
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,300
Her bone broke just because of that, huh?

204
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,300
It’s so brittle, right?

205
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:24,300
Seems wonderful…

206
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:30,500
After this, shocking development strikes to the members?!

207
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:41,100
There you have it, ”NO” team have come to Gunma!

208
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,100
We’ve arrived in Gunma!

209
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,900
Maiyan’s hometown.

210
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,900
Maiyan~
Maiyan~

211
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:47,300
No, not Maiyan.

212
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:50,400
Today, it seems like we’re short of one person.

213
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,400
It seems so.

214
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,400
Kazumin’s not here!

215
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,200
Takayama absent

216
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:55,500
<font size="9">What happened?</font>

217
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,500
What happened to Kazumin?

218
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:00,300
Kazumin is in a bad shape.

219
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:05,600
With Takayama out, “NO” team is reduced to three.

220
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,800
The three immediately faced the waterfall.

221
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:13,100
What on earth awaits them?

222
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:15,600
I could see it.

223
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,700
Wait, that one?

224
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:20,400


225
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,600
We are going there.

226
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:29,800
From this point, climbing up a trackless path takes 15 minutes.

227
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:36,900
The spray of water…

228
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,200
Eh? You’re kidding?

229
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,500
Pretty amazing.

230
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:52,900
The three will face a waterfall with a boasting height of 37 meters, 
Tanashita Fudou falls.

231
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:56,200
One of the top 100 waterfalls in Japan,

232
00:13:56,200 --> 00:14:00,000
this place is also used by monks for their training.

233
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,400
Among the waterfalls we have this time, this is the harshest.

234
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:10,700
This waterfall is perfectly suited for the hit prayer, 
Will the three of them be able to do this?

235
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:15,000
First, the three prayed for their safety.

236
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,900
Eyes open!

237
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:29,900
Then, finally, the three are headed to the waterfall.

238
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,400
First, their bodies are purified with salt.

239
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:42,700
<font size="10">That was rough!</font>

240
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,300
<font size="10">Isn’t this rough? </font>

241
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,100
Emphasizes on the face

242
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:48,900
<font size="10">It hurts!</font>

243
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:52,000
<font size="10">But this is a part 
of the purification, right?</font>

244
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:55,700
<font size="10">It’s an interesting prayer.</font>

245
00:14:55,700 --> 00:15:02,600
<font size="10">Something like this..</font>

246
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:05,600
<font size="10">That hurts! 
Interesting.</font>

247
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,800
At this point, Ikoma is…

248
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,900
Shivers.

249
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,300
<font size="10">Is it cold?</font>

250
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:16,800
<font size="10">It was cold that day, but…</font>

251
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:16,900
So cold… So cold… So cold…

252
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:19,000
<font size="10">Is that salt sticking 
on your face?</font>

253
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,200
I suddenly felt really cold.

254
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:28,300
Let’s go! 
-All right!

255
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:32,800
To get used to the cold, the three get in the water.

256
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,900
But right here, an accident regarding Ikoma.

257
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,300
Abiraunken!

258
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,300
Abiraunken~!

259
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:47,700
Abiraunken

260
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:49,700
Let’s go! 
-All right!

261
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,500
Not good. 
Not good.

262
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,700
Seriously, this is not good.

263
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:55,100
It hurts!

264
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,800
I’m really sorry…

265
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:06,000
Ikoma panicked while in the water,

266
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,900
Ikoma unexpectedly retires here.

267
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:11,500
<font size="10">As expected, Hashimoto is laughing hard.</font>

268
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:20,100
Finally, just the two of them entered the waterfall,

269
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:25,200
Will they be able to fill in Ikoma and Takayama’s share?

270
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,200
<font size="10">Do your best.</font>

271
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:30,300
<font size="10"></font>

272
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:33,300
<font size="10"></font>

273
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:35,900
Abiraunken~! Abiraunken~! Abiraunken~!

274
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:39,400


275
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:44,700
Abiraunken~! Abiraunken~! Abiraunken~!

276
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:48,300
<font size="10"></font>

277
00:16:50,300 --> 00:17:00,300
Wakatsuki, taking turns with Matsumura.

278
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,800
<font size="10">The water is quite strong.</font>

279
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:10,100
Abiraunken~! Abiraunken~! Abiraunken~!

280
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:12,600
<font size="10">Habiruanken ?</font>

281
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,500
<font size="10">Abiraunken.</font>

282
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,200
<font size="10">Abirau, right?</font>

283
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,400
<font size="10">Abiraunken!</font>

284
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:23,200
Both of them can’t withstand the cold and strong water pressure…

285
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:26,300
However, after that is…

286
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,900
Above the rock.

287
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,800
<font size="10">Eh? You’re going in there?</font>

288
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,700
<font size="10">That’s so cool!</font>

289
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:36,700
Then, Wakatsuki go towards the rocky area.

290
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:38,800
<font size="10">You’re really doing this?</font>

291
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,200
<font size="10">This is really cool.</font>

292
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,500
<font size="10">But it’s dangerous if you 
can’t withstand the pressure.</font>

293
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:45,300
<font size="10">That’s right.</font>

294
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:53,900
Abiraunken! Abiraunken! Abiraunken!

295
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:57,600
Abiraunken! Abiraunken! Abiraunken!

296
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:01,900
<font size="10">That’s a good one, 
Wakatsuki</font>

297
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:06,000
7th single, yoroshiku onegaishimasu~

298
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,200
<font size="10">You forgot to mention 
the title of the single.</font>

299
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:16,000
Then, Matsumura also go for the second time on the waterfall.

300
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:26,200
Abiraunken! Abiraunken! Abiraunken!

301
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,800
Abiraunken!

302
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:32,500
7th single, yoroshiku onegaishimasu~

303
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,800
Abiraunken! Abiraunken! Abiraunken!

304
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,200
<font size="10">You’re cold.</font>

305
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,600
<font size="10">That’s great.</font>

306
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,000
<font size="10">Really cool.</font>

307
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,100
<font size="10">It’s over with this, right?</font>

308
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:49,800
Doing even Ikoma and Takayama’s share, 
These two displayed their admirable will-power.

309
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,100
However, what was waiting for them is…

310
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,600
Unexpected third time.

311
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:09,800
Wakatsuki, Matsumura, on their sudden journey to the waterfall…

312
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:10,400
<font size="10">That’s cool.</font>

313
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,300
<font size="10">It’s really cool!</font>

314
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:13,600
<font size="10">The water is strong.</font>

315
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,300
Abiraunken! Abiraunken! Abiraunken!

316
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:16,300
<font size="10">Intense, right?</font>

317
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:27,200
Praying for the 7th single, to become a big hit! Yoroshiku onegaishimasu~ 
-Onegaishimasu!

318
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,500
Se~
No~

319
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:33,800
”Barrette, it rests on your hair”

320
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:39,500
"like a large butterfly"

321
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:43,500
"Barrette, raising its wings,"

322
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:51,200
"not wanting to be noticed, it sits still, like me.”

323
00:19:51,200 --> 00:20:05,900
Barrette, yoroshiku onegaishimasu!

324
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:10,400
Team “NO,” a splendid hit prayer, a big success!

325
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,600
Team NO’s waterfall campaign was excellent, but…

326
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,000
Let’s start off with Takayama.

327
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:16,600
I’m really sorry.

328
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:17,700
Why? What happened?

329
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:22,100
From the previous recording, that one with the draw lots,

330
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,200
I have cough.

331
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,100
You were coughing, right?

332
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:27,100
Then it got worse…

333
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:29,700
that’s why…

334
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,700
You are considering your physical condition.

335
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:32,300
Disappointing stoppage from doctor

336
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:34,700
The doctor stopped you from participating.

337
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:37,900
Then, among the three who are able to do this, 
suddenly on the last minute, Ikoma.

338
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,500
Trauma switch: ON

339
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:40,800
You got terrified?

340
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:41,700
I deeply apologize.

341
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:42,700
So with that, it became just the two of you.

342
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:43,700
-Yes 
-These two are amazing.

343
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,200
Furthermore, they did it a lot of times.

344
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:49,000
When you thought it was over, the monk is right there like DADAN! 

345
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,400
DADAN!

346
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,100
That was really funny.

347
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:55,900
I never thought that we’ll go there.

348
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:58,300
I’ve never heard that we’ll do it several times.

349
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,200
So you’ve never heard that you’ll do it three times

350
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:03,500
I thought it was over after my turn, then when I got out he is already on top!

351
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:03,500
Constantly going off on his own.

352
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,000
With that timing?

353
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
DADAN, please get on with this.

354
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:14,000
After this, the new song “Barrette” 
will be performed in this program for the first time.

355
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:20,300
Please watch the studio performance of the new song “Barrette”

356
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:27,900
Barrette
Lyrics:Akimoto Yasushi
Music:Saito Yoshihiro

357
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,900


358
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:36,700
Barrette, it rests on your hair

359
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:42,700
like a large butterfly.

360
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:45,400
Barrette

361
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,400
raising its wings,

362
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:53,100
not wanting to be noticed, it sits still

363
00:21:53,100 --> 00:22:04,400
like me.

364
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:09,000
By the window in the library,

365
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:15,200
female students whisper, conspiring,

366
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,200
While reading Hemmingway,

367
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:25,300
I glanced over them.

368
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:28,400
Tracing the movements of their lips in my mind

369
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,600
Tracing the movements of their lips in my mind

370
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:35,700
Can I get a hint?

371
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:39,500
By chance, our eyes met

372
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:44,300
As if you peeked into my heart

373
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:48,400
I already raised the white flag.

374
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:53,800
Barrette, in the wind,

375
00:22:54,500 --> 00:23:00,100
You hold down your dancing hair.

376
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:05,000
Barrette, the sun,

377
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,600
Ah, it seems so bright,

378
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,600
I had to avert my eyes

379
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:13,900
It’s like you

380
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:26,300
Barrette, a lot like you,

381
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:29,600
with your mischievous eyes,

382
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,300
you smiled at me,

383
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:34,300
I wonder why?
