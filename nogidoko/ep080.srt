<font size="38">“Since I got in the senbatsu, I’ll do the things I can with my best effort."</font>

148
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:14,510
<font size="38">From here on out,</font>

149
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:22,480
<font size="38">I’d like to be able to do those things I thought I can’t.</font>

150
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:26,190
<font size="38">To make everyone stronger, there’s someone there who serves as a replacement, right?</font>

151
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:30,020
<font size="38">I think that it’s nice to have these kinds of feelings sprout.</font>

152
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:33,290
<font size="38">There’s one person left for the 3rd row. 
-Just one more person, huh?</font>

153
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:39,160
<font size="38">For the 6th single, all that’s left in the 3rd row is the #13 spot.</font>

154
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:42,170
<font size="38">The next senbatsu member, #13</font>

155
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:46,070
<font size="38">Who will be chosen for the last spot in the 3rd row?</font>

156
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:47,770
<font size="38">Hoshino Minami</font>

157
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,040
<font size="38">Eh?</font>

158
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,040
<font size="38">Oh?</font>

159
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:58,320
<font size="38">Hoshino has always been... 
-She has always been in the front.</font>

160
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,120
<font size="38">That's true.</font>

161
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:05,820
<font size="38">Hoshino Minami who has been mainly a front member for the past singles is now in the 3rd row.</font>

162
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:08,490
<font size="38">How about this? How are you feeling right now?</font>

163
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:11,060
<font size="38">To be honest, I felt relieved...</font>

164
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:11,930
<font size="38">Eh?</font>

165
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,130
<font size="38">Right now…</font>

166
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,240
<font size="38">There are a lot of things where I get confused.</font>

167
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:24,080
<font size="38">It’s like… the pressure, I mean...</font>

168
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:30,450
<font size="38">This time… what number? I’m in the #13 spot,</font>

169
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:33,850
<font size="38">but I’d like to give it my all for the 6th single.</font>

170
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:39,460
<font size="38">Being in front means that you’ll be subjected to a lot of criticism.</font>

171
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:43,560
<font size="38">You did all that while being under pressure?</font>

172
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:49,030
<font size="38">We thought you couldn’t feel any of it…</font>

173
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:52,240
<font size="38">but now that I’ve heard about it, I thought, “Ah, really?”</font>

174
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,370
<font size="38">Do your best. 
-I’ll do my best in the 6th single.</font>

175
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:56,640
<font size="38">That’s nice, do your best okay? 
-Nice.</font>

176
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,140
<font size="38">Thank you very much.</font>

177
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:01,650
<font size="38">Eh? So that’s how it goes.</font>

178
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:10,260
<font size="38">Within the 8-Fukujin, it has been decided that two members will be replaced.</font>

179
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:14,090
<font size="38">That concludes the announcement for the 3rd row.</font>

180
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:16,800
<font size="38">Akimoto and Hoshino are out of the 8-Fukujin.</font>

181
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,970
<font size="38">Furthermore , Ito Marika and Saito Yuuri from under made it in the senbatsu.</font>

182
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:27,970
<font size="38">Right here, we’ll inform Saito who is currently on-air about getting in the senbatsu.</font>

183
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:30,710
<font size="38">Someone’s on the line.</font>

184
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:31,810
<font size="38">Hello?</font>

185
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:32,880
<font size="38">Ah, hello?</font>

186
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:33,810
<font size="38">Who is this?</font>

187
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:36,050
<font size="38">This is Bananaman.</font>

188
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:38,780
<font size="38">Which one of the Bananaman?</font>

189
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:41,020
<font size="38">The one speaking right now is Shitara.</font>

190
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:41,920
<font size="38">Ah, Shitara-san.</font>

191
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:42,720
<font size="38">Yes, and then…</font>

192
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,890
<font size="38">Hello, this is Himura, hello, pardon us.</font>

193
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:45,960
<font size="38">Ah, hello~</font>

194
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:51,060
<font size="38">On our end, we’re also in the middle of recording Nogizaka’s show, NogiDoko.</font>

195
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:54,330
<font size="38">We have something to tell to Saito Yuuri.</font>

196
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:58,640
<font size="38">You’re currently on-air, but could we have her for a moment?</font>

197
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,070
<font size="38">She’s right in front of me right now.</font>

198
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:01,240
<font size="38">Really?</font>

199
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,370
<font size="38">Onizuka-san, please excuse us for a while.</font>

200
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:03,210
<font size="38">Saito Yuuri here.</font>

201
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:06,950
<font size="38">Starting from this spring, you’ll be doing a radio show? 
-Yes, that’s right, it has been decided.</font>

202
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:09,920
<font size="38">Yes, I am. I’m really really nervous though.</font>

203
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,320
<font size="38">We’re currently on-air right? 
-Yes, that’s right. We’re on-air.</font>

204
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,150
<font size="38">Really?</font>

205
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:15,890
<font size="38">What’s the meaning of this?</font>

206
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:20,190
<font size="38">Ah, you see, right now, we’re announcing the senbatsu for the 6th single.</font>

207
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:21,460
<font size="38">Eh? Why?!</font>

208
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:23,330
<font size="38">Why didn’t they call me?</font>

209
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:25,030
<font size="40"><b>Wasn’t called.</b></font>

210
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:28,170
<font size="38">The schedule is overlapping.</font>

211
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,600
<font size="38">For the 6th single, Saito Yuuri,</font>

212
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:34,370
<font size="38">you made it in the senbatsu!</font>

213
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:36,270
<font size="38">Eh? Is that true?</font>

214
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:37,780
<font size="38">That's great!</font>

215
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:39,380
<font size="38">Amazing!</font>

216
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:42,350
<font size="38">Onizuka-san, Saito Yuuri made it in the senbatsu!</font>

217
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:44,380
<font size="38">Amazing!</font>

218
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:45,950
<font size="40"><b>Great excitement.</b></font>

219
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:47,850
<font size="38">She made it in!</font>

220
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:50,520
<font size="38">Is this a prank? 
-She made it in!</font>

221
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:52,220
<font size="38">omedetou!</font>

222
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:55,260
<font size="38">Saito, please tell us how you feel right now.</font>

223
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:56,530
<font size="38">Is it okay to say it here?</font>

224
00:11:56,530 --> 00:11:57,030
<font size="38">Say it!</font>

225
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:01,300
<font size="38">It’s like… what is it? It feels like a prank,</font>

226
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:03,640
<font size="38">I never thought I would be called.</font>

227
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:06,810
<font size="38">Eh? What to do? I’m happy but I’m freaking out!</font>

228
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:11,010
<font size="38">With that, sorry for the intrusion, that’s all we wanted to say.</font>

229
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:12,140
<font size="38">Oh is that so?</font>

230
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:12,740
<font size="38">Eh?</font>

231
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:14,710
<font size="38">T-Thank you very much.</font>

232
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:18,920
<font size="38">Pardon us for the intrusion. Saito Yuuri, do your best!</font>

233
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:19,820
<font size="38">I'll do my best!</font>

234
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:21,950
<font size="38">Bye bye! 
-Goodbye!</font>

235
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:26,590
<font size="38">After this, a great turn of events in the senbatsu announcement?!</font>

236
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:32,830
<font size="38">Nogizaka46 6th single, next is the announcements for the 2nd row.</font>

237
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:36,230
<font size="38">The next senbatsu announcement, #8</font>

238
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:40,110
<font size="38">The first one who’ll get in the 8-Fukujin is…</font>

239
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:42,270
<font size="38">Takayama Kazumi</font>

240
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,580
<font size="38">Takayama! omedetou~</font>

241
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:46,950
<font size="38">Takayama, 8-Fukujin!</font>

242
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:53,720
<font size="38">Takayama Kazumi made her way back to the 8-Fukujin 
after getting in the 2nd single four singles back.</font>

243
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:56,150
<font size="38">During the time I've spent in the #16 spot,</font>

244
00:12:56,820 --> 00:13:00,560
<font size="38">I’ve had this feeling of wanting to go up front.</font>

245
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:08,630
<font size="38">The amount of opportunities I had when I was in the 8-Fukujin,</font>

246
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:10,740
<font size="38">I realized about it when I was in the #16 spot.</font>

247
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:14,210
<font size="38">I’m really happy because of it.</font>

248
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:16,910
<font size="38">You were wondering if you’re gonna drop from your position last time,</font>

249
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:19,580
<font size="38">considering the various changes we’re seeing, right?</font>

250
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:22,750
<font size="38">Is it…</font>

251
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:25,820
<font size="38">enough already?</font>

252
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:26,850
<font size="40"><b>Is it enough already?</b></font>

253
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:29,960
<font size="38">What do you mean by that?</font>

254
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:35,260
<font size="38">I got you. That feeling of wanting to be happy also exists, that…</font>

255
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:36,630
<font size="38">You don’t know how to explain it, right?</font>

256
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:39,870
<font size="38">But still, you were chosen. 
-I’m thankful.</font>

257
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:41,370
<font size="38">You’re grateful, that’s nice. 
-I’m thankful.</font>

258
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:44,200
<font size="38">Well then, please appreciate it. 
omedetou~</font>

259
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:48,440
<font size="38">Takayama entering the 8-Fukujin has been decided,</font>

260
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,610
<font size="38">There are seven spots remaining.</font>

261
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:53,650
<font size="38">The next senbatsu member, #4</font>

262
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:56,680
<font size="38">The next one who will be chosen is?</font>

263
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,250
<font size="38">Sakurai Reika</font>

264
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:01,720
<font size="38">Oh, Sakurai, omedetou~</font>

265
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:09,160
<font size="38">Captain Sakurai made it in the 8-Fukujin for the 3rd consecutive time.</font>

266
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:11,730
<font size="38">I also graduated from high school,</font>

267
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:17,900
<font size="38">the environment has also changed considerably for me.</font>

268
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:24,740
<font size="38">For my personal charm to also increase regardless of being the captain,</font>

269
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:28,350
<font size="38">for the fans to think that “We want to support you from now on.”</font>

270
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:33,690
<font size="38">I want to work hard to become that kind of member.</font>

271
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:36,860
<font size="38">We’ll look forward to it. Do your best.</font>

272

<font size="38">6 people remaining.</font>

<font size="38">Nishino Nanase</font>

276
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:54,640
<font size="38">Nishino made it in!</font>

277
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:01,310
<font size="38">Nishino Nanase made her way back to the 8-Fukujin 
after getting in the 3rd single three singles back.</font>

278
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:05,750
<font size="38">Ever since falling out of the 8-Fukujin during the 4th single,</font>

279
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:10,990
<font size="38">I’m really frustrated, I’ve always been.</font>

280
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,090
<font size="38">then,</font>

281
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:17,930
<font size="38">gradually, I’ve become pessimistic.</font>

282
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:24,240
<font size="38">Even while on the train, I’m only thinking about the comments when I dropped.</font>

283
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:26,140
<font size="38">But you’ve made it in now.</font>

284
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:30,840
<font size="38">I really like the #7, I’m glad,</font>

285
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:33,080
<font size="38">so I'd like to do my best.</font>

286

<font size="38">Ikuta Erika</font>

290
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:53,630
<font size="38">hai, Ikuta, omedetou~</font>

291
00:15:55,030 --> 00:16:00,070
<font size="38">Ikuta Erika who was a front member for three consecutive times
 is now in the 2nd row, #5 spot.</font>

292
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:06,110
<font size="38">Because I’ll be able to see a different view than before,</font>

293
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:13,590
<font size="38">I’m really looking forward to the amount of hard work I’ll put in.</font>

294
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:16,660
<font size="38">I’d like to give it my all.</font>

295
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,120
<font size="38">Do your best.</font>

296
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,520
<font size="38">I'll do my best.</font>

297
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,760
<font size="38">Please go ahead. omedetou gozaimasu~</font>

298
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:29,770
<font size="38">We’re down to just four spots.</font>

299
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:31,340
<font size="38">Is this the last one for the 2nd row?</font>

300
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:32,340
<font size="38">Yes, it is the last one.</font>

301
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:37,040
<font size="38">For the 6th single, Hoshino and Ikuta who were front members in the last single are moved to the back.</font>

302
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,410
<font size="38">Next is the last one for the 2nd row.</font>

303
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,310
<font size="38">The next senbatsu member, #6</font>

304
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:45,850
<font size="38">Who will be chosen?</font>

305
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:48,390
<font size="38">Ikoma Rina</font>

306
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:51,920
<font size="38">Ikoma</font>

307
00:16:53,590 --> 00:17:09,940
<font size="38">This is quite something.</font>

308
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:11,710
<font size="38">This is quite something.</font>

309
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:19,020
<font size="38">You’ve always been the center since Nogizaka46 has started.</font>

310
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:24,560
<font size="38">Is there anything you have to say?</font>

311
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:33,100
<font size="38">I’ve always thought that there’ll be changes someday..</font>

312
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:36,230
<font size="38">..that’s why I was always prepared for this.</font>

313
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:45,110
<font size="38">The #2 spot (center) is the only world that I knew,</font>

314
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:53,480
<font size="38">so I’ve also received words…</font>

315
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:56,650
<font size="38">...that hurt me a lot.</font>

316
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,430
<font size="38">But, these changes…</font>

317
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:07,630
<font size="38">these changes right now, since it is the first time this happened,</font>

318
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:11,270
<font size="38">It’s like.. I can’t understand it very well…</font>

319
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:15,140
<font size="38">We were also surprised by it.</font>

320
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:17,610
<font size="38">That’s right, it was surprising.</font>

321
00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:21,780
<font size="38">Ikoma was the center of Nogizaka after all.</font>

322
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:25,520
<font size="38">But this is a fresh start,</font>

323
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:29,820
<font size="38">it could be something different again.</font>

324
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:36,190
<font size="38">It might take you some time to accept all this.</font>

325
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:43,230
<font size="38">Ikoma Rina who has served as the fixed center since Nogizaka46 was formed,</font>

326
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:45,300
<font size="38">is out of the center position for the first time.</font>

327
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:49,510
<font size="38">After this, the big announcement for the front members!</font>

328
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:55,580
<font size="38">Right now, up to the #5 spot were called, Ikoma, however, is resting for a bit.</font>

329
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:59,020
<font size="38">We’ll continue without Ikoma here right now.</font>

330
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:03,250
<font size="38">All that’s left for the 6th single are the three front members.</font>

331
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:06,360
<font size="38">The next senbatsu member, #1</font>

332
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:10,060
<font size="38">The next member for the 6th single is…</font>

333
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:12,430
<font size="38">Matsumura Sayuri</font>

334
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:21,640
<font size="38">Matsumura Sayuri who was in the 2nd row for all of the singles starting from the first single,</font>

335
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,680
<font size="38">made it to the front position that she’s been longing for.</font>

336
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:30,480
<font size="38">From the 1st single, I’ve always thought that “I really want to go up front.”</font>

337
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,490
<font size="38">And then, even the fans at handshake events,</font>

338
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:40,930
<font size="38">they were always telling me “Go up front even more!”</font>

339
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:45,730
<font size="38">We’ve done 5 singles already, but I’ve always been in the 2nd row.</font>

340
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:48,100
<font size="38">I’m 20 years old,</font>

341
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:51,140
<font size="38">and among the members, I am one of the tallest,</font>

342
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:55,270
<font size="38">I’ll get in the way of others when I go up front, so it’s impossible.</font>

343
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:56,810
<font size="38">Don’t worry about those kinds of things.</font>

344
00:19:56,810 --> 00:20:01,880
<font size="38">I just keep on making excuses.</font>

345
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:06,620
<font size="38">I’m a step closer to the place I didn’t get to go to.</font>

346
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:12,960
<font size="38">I think this is where it really starts,</font>

347
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,390
<font size="38">I won’t give in from this position.</font>

348
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:20,430
<font size="38">I’d like to work with self-confidence.</font>

349
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:24,800
<font size="38">There’ll be a lot of opportunities for you to see, so please work hard.</font>

350
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,500
<font size="38">I will.</font>

351
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,470
<font size="38">Do your best, okay?</font>

352
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:33,880
<font size="38">For the 6th single, just 2 people remaining. 
-Just two, huh?</font>

353
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:36,710
<font size="38">The next senbatsu member, #3</font>

354
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:40,120
<font size="38">The next member for the 6th single is…</font>

355
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:42,250
<font size="38">Hashimoto Nanami</font>

356
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:46,090
<font size="38">Hashimoto, hai, omedetou~</font>

357
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:52,000
<font size="38">Just like Matsumura,</font>

358
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:57,170
<font size="38">Hashimoto Nanami who was in the 2nd row for all of the singles starting from the first single, she made it to the front.</font>

359
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:01,940
<font size="38">I was always in the same spot on the 2nd row, but…</font>

360
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:03,880
<font size="38">honestly,</font>

361
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:10,820
<font size="38">that spot has become a comfortable spot for me, in both good way and bad way.</font>

362
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:13,080
<font size="38">This time, I was given this position,</font>

363
00:21:13,890 --> 00:21:19,760
<font size="38">It would be nice if I could build self-confidence and do my best in the 6th single.</font>

364
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:23,860
<font size="38">I'll do my best. 
-hai, omedetou~</font>

365
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:30,230
<font size="38">Only one left for the 6th single,</font>

366
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:31,940
<font size="38">the announcement for center.</font>

367
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:34,770
<font size="38">The next senbatsu member, #2</font>

368
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:38,940
<font size="38">The last one for the 6th single is?</font>

369
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,680
<font size="38">Shiraishi Mai</font>

370
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:43,010
<font size="38">hai, Shiraishi~</font>

371
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:51,090
<font size="38">Shiraishi Mai who was in the 2nd row for all of the singles,</font>

372
00:21:51,090 --> 00:22:00,570
<font size="38">is selected as Nogizaka46’s new center.</font>

373
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:05,500
<font size="38">Shiraishi, you are in the center position.</font>

374
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,370
<font size="38">For me as well, I've always been in the the 2nd row,</font>

375
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:16,150
<font size="38">rather than feeling relieved, it was more of “I’ll do my best in this position again.”</font>

376
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:23,150
<font size="38">This time, I’m taking one step further.</font>

377
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:34,170
<font size="38">There is a lot of pressure, along with the things that I have to be responsible of.</font>

378
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:39,370
<font size="38">Since I was given this position,</font>

379
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:44,240
<font size="38">I will work very hard and have a lot of people take notice,</font>

380
00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:50,580
<font size="38">I’d like to give my best effort in order to get acknowledged.</font>

381
00:22:54,090 --> 00:22:56,490
<font size="38">Do your best, okay? 
-Do your best.</font>

382
00:22:56,490 --> 00:22:59,090
<font size="38">Proceed to the center position.</font>

383
00:22:59,090 --> 00:23:01,490
<font size="38">Thank you very much. 
-hai, omedetou~</font>

384
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:03,960
<font size="38">There we have it,</font>

385
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:07,400
<font size="38">The 16 senbatsu members for the 6th single have been decided!</font>

386
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:12,140
<font size="38">I think this is the biggest change we’ve had so far,</font>

387
00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:14,570
<font size="38">This coming summer,</font>

388
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:18,510
<font size="38">Nogizaka’s activities will be more active than ever,</font>

389
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:22,580
<font size="38">we’ll get to challenge a lot of new things, that’s why…</font>

390
00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:25,780
<font size="38">we’ll gather ourselves in this fresh start.</font>

391
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:29,220
<font size="38">So that we could produce a single better than what we’ve put out so far,</font>

392
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:32,890
<font size="38">We’d like to help one another,combine our efforts and work hard.</font>

393
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:35,330
<font size="38">For the 6th single as well, ,yoroshiku onegaishimasu~</font>
