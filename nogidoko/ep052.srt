At first, I wanna get close to Nishino, I greeted her, but...

116
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:07,400
Na-chan didn't answer. More like making a wall between us.

00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:47,400
That time, it's all just a lie ^^

167
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Fukagawa, you wanna say something
about Matsumura, right?

168
00:12:52,600 --> 00:13:00,200
At first I think Matsumura
is a quiet and shy girl.

169
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,900
- But all of a sudden, she have
this secret power "SAYURINGO PUNCH".
- What?

170
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,200

00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,400
- Secret power?
- Yes, that secret power ...

172
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,200
Hmmm... why did you need a secret power?

173
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,900
Suddenly she start using her secret power.

174
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:19,100
- Is that related to your PR?
- Yes, of course. In my PR.

175
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:22,000
Ok, do it.

176
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000

we always sit next to each other.

185
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:02,900
She doesn't want to look at me,
No response either when I try to talk with her.

186
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,700
And now?

187
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:09,000
Now, we already start touching each other.

188
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:10,700
- Touching?
- What does that mean?

189
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:17,100
Reika always can't stop talking,
while moving her face closer to mine.

190
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:21,400
That's annoying, so I get rid of her with spit.

191
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,400
- Wait...
- That's so wrong.

192
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:31,100
- Seems like you're the only one who act sadist here.

The way you communicate is unique.

194
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:42,514
Even before the show, we're all spitted by her
while saying some kind of spell.

195
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,200

But, I have my own appeal that
young girls don't have, such as sexyness.

203
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:24,300
I'm always cool-headed and
I will not lose.
