And thats when Akimoto...

367
00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:11,590
ah

368
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,820
This...this picture

369
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:15,800
remember this one?

370
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:18,900
Is that...Yohohama arena?

371
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:19,920
that's right

372
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:23,910
Yokohama Arena...the 2nd Birthday Live show

373
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,270
I remember it

374
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,080
after the show

375
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:29,450
after the show in the hallways

376
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:31,120
I saw Naachan

377
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,080
you were like "what should I do"

378
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:36,280
I had my phone and was trying to get a picture and you're like "what should I do"

379
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:38,110
[ One unforgettable picture ]

380
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:40,230
For Akimoto this picture

381
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,490
is a picture she'll never forget

382
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,760
Akimoto due to her studies

383
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:50,260
even being an original member, didn't participate with the group until the 4th single

384
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:53,970
And for that 4th single

385
00:18:55,240 --> 00:19:00,930
Akimoto Manatsu

386
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:03,350
Akimoto...Akimoto Manatsu-san?

387
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:06,000
Is Akimoto-san here?

388
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:07,540
hai

389
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:09,000
You've been called...dozo

390
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,810
Right this way

391
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:13,860
Without ever being involved in the groups activities

392
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:16,350
she was suddenly selected into Hachi Fukujin

393
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,290
Before Akimoto joined the group

394
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:22,120
Nishino had made it into Hachi Fukujin but was now dropped to the 3rd row

395
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:27,860
Well you have no other choice but to do your best

396
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:30,470
Please keep thinking about your future

397
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:35,110
Nishino felt she had been dropped to make room for Akimoto

398
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,470
This started a tense relationship with Akimoto

399
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:40,090
From that point on

400
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:44,070
they spent over a year not talking to each other

401
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:49,980
With all that the turning point in their relationship

402
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:53,530
was here for the Yokohama 2nd Birthday Live

403
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:55,340
it was when Nishino did this

404
00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:58,660
The words I couldn't say to her back then

405
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:00,910
I'll use those words to start this song

406
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:04,350
Manatsu okaeri

407
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:06,360
Let's do our best together

408
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:12,570
those words from Nishino dissolved the bad feelings between them

409
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:15,910
I wanted to be friends

410
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:18,550
but we never spoke to each other

411
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:28,870
arigatou...ganbatte ne

412
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:35,590
That's why for Akimoto, the Yokohama Arena

413
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:37,640
and this photo she took after the live show

414
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:39,810
has become an unforgettable treasure

415
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,480
I don't think I've ever gotten that emotional

416
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,280
When that happened

417
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:47,970
I wasn't thinking I'm going to start something

418
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:50,260
of course

419
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:54,180
the reason this all started

420
00:20:54,180 --> 00:21:01,360
I felt the reason was because I was being too childish

421
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,650
Now then before Nishino graduates

422
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:06,530
the things she couldn't say before...she'll tell Akimoto her feelings

423
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,400
Its like

424
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:12,490
even though all that happened...like now

425
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:17,060
how its completely

426
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,150
that ill will

427
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:23,620
I didn't think it would completely clean up all of it

428
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:25,650
so then why

429
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:28,780
how did our relationship improve like this

430
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:30,610
yabai

431
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:32,210
when I think why

432
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:35,240
its definitely because of Manatsu's character

433
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:39,670
If it were a girl that didn't have Manatsu's character

434
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:42,580
I don't think there's any way we could be together like this

435
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:44,580
No...thats not true

436
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:47,190
This history

437
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:50,960
its become deeper

438
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,430
between us

439
00:21:52,430 --> 00:21:54,110
Because of that

440
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:57,340
your graduation

441
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,150
you announced it in front of everyone

442
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:02,190
When you said "I'm graduating"

443
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:06,100
I've never trembled that bad ever...it wouldn't stop

444
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:09,060
I never imagined it could happen

445
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:19,690
Back to what we were talking about...at Yokohama Arena

446
00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:22,280
okaeri Manatsu

447
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,810
I did say that

448
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:27,390
But this time for the 22nd single

449
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:30,350
in the MV for it

450
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:34,840
Manatsu says okaeri to me....for me personally

451
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:36,380
that was really

452
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,540
incredible...was that a coincidence?

453
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:43,530
A favorite scene for Nishino that reminds her of their past history

454
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:45,770
that scene from the music video is right here

455
00:22:55,210 --> 00:22:56,930
How come Manatsu

456
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:59,030
says "okaeri" in that scene

457
00:22:59,610 --> 00:23:00,960
its probably

458
00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:03,600
it may just be a coincidence but

459
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,320
sugoi

460
00:23:05,370 --> 00:23:07,120
personally

461
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:08,290
that was a good point

462
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:09,870
ah is that so

463
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:12,680
I'm the one saying it but

464
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,200
it brought back a lot of memories

465
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:16,820
Its become something we have in common

466
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:20,890
The bus heading home carrying both of their memories

467
00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:22,080
makes a stop right here

468
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:24,710
Akimoto will depart here

469
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:27,980
which member will get on the bus next?

470
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:29,720
Nishino

471
00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:30,160
hai

472
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:31,980
Nishino and Akimoto

473
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:33,530
both of you look like you're about to cry

474
00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:36,110
now I've got a runny nose

475
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:37,480
Go ahead and show some snot...I don't mind

476
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:38,530
[ Don't hold back ]

477
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:40,310
Reminded you of the past then

478
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:41,900
and you teared up

479
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:44,280
Its really strange

480
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:47,130
I'm not trying to cry but watching that

481
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:49,750
Its because there's a history

482
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:52,410
We had no idea you two weren't getting along

483
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:54,220
I had no idea

484
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:56,950
I thought you were having a good time

485
00:23:57,160 --> 00:24:00,050
Being a part of Fukujin

486
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:02,550
on the inside...what do you call it

487
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:05,300
You felt like you had been kicked out

488
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:06,570
And then suddenly its like

489
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:08,250
You're like "why you little..."

490
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:10,770
This girl comes in and I'm kicked out?!

491
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:15,560
I had those kinds of immature emotions

492
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:18,740
But still you managed to make up

493
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,570
you told her okaeri

494
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:22,140
Akimoto is sobbing too right?

495
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:24,680
I really wasn't expecting that

496
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:27,640
Its actually turned into a good memory hasn't it

497
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,540
You could say it brought us closer
