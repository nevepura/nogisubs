49
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:35,280
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">Because there was no instructor, we couldn't go deep.</font>

50
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,970
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">- Because you just want to experience it, right? 
 - We were just in the shallow water.</font>

51
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:40,370
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">Even so, it was really enjoyable.</font>

<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">- Enjoyable, right?
- So enjoyable, you know.</font>

63
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:12,650
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">Why? Why?</font>

64
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:15,540
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">You did it alone?</font>

65
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:20,680

66
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,970

67
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:25,170
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">It's being fed. Feed can be given to fish.</font>

68

- Why alone?</font>

69

72
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:40,680
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">said "My leg is heavy" "It's hard to breathe". Then they didn't come underwater.</font>

73
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:44,400
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">All the time, I was feeding alone, filming alone, and taking photos alone.</font>

74

00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:23,900
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">Right, attached in the backpack.</font>

259
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:28,110
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">I always get to drink a little while walking.</font>

260
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:32,760
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">It's a really fun way to walk and be healthy simultaneously.</font>

261
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,760
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">If you have a big tank, you'll keep drinking.</font>

262
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,550
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">The tank is a little heavy.</font>

263
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:39,550
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">Tonkotsu soup or something.</font>

264
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:39,550
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="31"><b>{\an8}(Note) Tonkotsu soup is similar to pork stew</b></font>

265
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:42,720
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">The idea of a pig.</font>

266
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:47,520
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">Dangerous, you might bring sake for that, but not tonkotsu</font>

267
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,410
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">Isn't that good?</font>

268
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:55,500
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">At the peak, wouldn't you want to eat delicious food?</font>

269
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:59,370
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">- I want to eat. 
 - Recently, convenient food has greatly developed.</font>

270
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:02,810
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">This kinoko pasta. Just add some hot water and you can eat it.</font>

271
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:07,360
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">- It sounds like fun. 
 - I want to try this.</font>

272
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:07,800
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">And next!</font>

273
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,800
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">Speaking of mountain, it's bear!</font>

274
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,660
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">Well.. bear.</font>

275
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:14,240
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">A bear can possibly come out too, can't it?</font>

276
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:18,800
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">There is a countermeasure good. It's a bear spray, like this one.</font>

277
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,060
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">Can this be used?</font>

278
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:25,720
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">This is a pepper spray that will make bears really uncomfortable.</font>

279
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:29,340
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">Bear is in fact particularly timid.</font>

280
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:32,510
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">They don't come near where humans are talking.</font>

281
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:34,510
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">For example, on a road corner...</font>

282
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:38,890
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">there will be a pattern where we encounter a bear.</font>

283
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:41,790
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">If you use this spray...</font>

284
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:45,150
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">It is possible to walk away safely while protecting yourself.</font>

285
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:48,780
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">When you meet it at the corner, from your bag you need to take it out.</font>

286
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:51,690
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">But it's right here, from here.</font>

287
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:53,610
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">Why?</font>

288
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:55,840
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">Why are you having a drink at this time!</font>

289
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,770
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">You will be knocked down before you do it.</font>

290
00:12:57,770 --> 00:13:00,240
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">But it is easily reachable as it hangs right here.</font>

291
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,350
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">Does it hang properly there?</font>

292
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:04,750
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">- Does it keep hanging on this all the time? 
 - Yes, it is.</font>

293
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,170
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">Is it so dangerous?</font>

294
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:08,300
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">- It is not that dangerous. 
 - That's its place.</font>

295
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:09,020
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">It could be.</font>

296
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:11,180
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">Encountering bears is dangerous.</font>

297
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:12,410
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">And one more...</font>

298
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:17,320
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">Bee... or snake. If you're bitten...</font>

299
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,600
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">Use this product immediately.</font>

300
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,790
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">It will suck the venom out.</font>

301
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,060
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">What is this?</font>

302
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:26,060
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">- Properly. 
 - This is from some time ago.</font>

303
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:28,840
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">Shiraishi, if a snake comes out, it will be okay.</font>

304
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,430
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">No, absolutely impossible!</font>

305
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:34,490
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">You can choose the clothes too.</font>

306
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:36,830
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">- There are many kinds. 
 - Many cute ones.</font>

307
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:39,390
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">I have recently been told about climbing women.</font>

308
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:43,480
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">It's possible to pick what you like with your own selection.</font>

309
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:47,450
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">It's dangerous to fall into outdoor goods.</font>

310
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:47,630
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">Ikoma in changing room</font>

311
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:49,020
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">It was very cute.</font>

312
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:52,780
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">So I took the chance to try it on.</font>

313
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:57,320
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">- I wonder what you'll wear. 
 - What I wear. Here it is.</font>

314
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:00,200
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">Ah! Here it is!</font>

315
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,610
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">This one, and...</font>

316
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:03,610
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">great headgear.</font>

317
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:07,720
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">Because I care about ultraviolet rays, I use a big hat.</font>

318
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,550
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">But if it was sunglasses here...</font>

319
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:12,400
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">I'll be unrecognized somehow.</font>

320
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,400
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">Without being seen by anyone.</font>

321
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:18,350
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">- Very good. 
 - Like a pro.</font>

322
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:23,630
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">But it's good. Somehow I want to go climbing.</font>

323
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:26,240
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">I was so prepared for this...</font>

324
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,840
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">Because I think it was a great feeling.</font>

325
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:31,550
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">So I begin to do shopping in mountaineering.</font>

326
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:33,020
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">I might be a good thing.</font>

327
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:33,520
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">Taste climbing gourmet</font>

328
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:38,870
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">Here you can see the climber gourmet introduced in the studio.</font>

329
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:40,800
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">Today, it's this mochi.</font>

330
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,480
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">- It's mochi. 
 - Can you eat this?</font>

331
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:46,350
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">Eating mochi on the mountain.</font>

332
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:48,280
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">Please imagine that you are eating at the summit.</font>

333
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,280
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">- Got it! 
 - OK.</font>

334
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:53,180
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">Ah, I do not want to eat mochi at the summit.</font>

335
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:55,600
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">Wrong. No, no, wrong.</font>

336
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,000
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">Sorry, sorry.</font>

337
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,580

 - This is mochi.</font>

338
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:59,580
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">- It's stiff. 
 - It's hard.</font>

339
00:14:59,680 --> 00:14:59,870
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">Waters mochi: Add water and wait for 3 minutes</font>

340
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:04,220
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">Just pour water into the container and wait three minutes.</font>

341
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,560
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">- Does this only need to be watered? 
 - Just water.</font>

342
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,320
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">Is this boiled water?</font>

343
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,170
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">Just some water.</font>

344
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:14,030
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">Seriously!? Only water?</font>

345
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:15,680
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">Ah, great! Great!</font>

346
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,940
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">- Now it has become mochi. 
 - It's mochi.</font>

347
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:22,140
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">It got so sticky.</font>

348
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:27,080
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">- It's okay with water. 
 - It's amazing how it's okay with water.</font>

349
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,080
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">It's isobe mochi.</font>

350
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:32,800
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">- It's soybean flour. 
 - It's soybean flour, isn't it?</font>

351
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,240
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">Oh, but it's delicious.</font>

352
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,240
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">It's soy sauce powder.</font>

353
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,760
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">Look at this. It's soy sauce.</font>

354
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,910
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">It contains a soy powder and seaweed.</font>

355
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:42,280
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">Amazing.</font>

356
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:49,360
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">The smell, the smell comes out.</font>

357

363
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:16,200
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">What if you eat this at the top?</font>

364
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:20,040
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">Cover it up.</font>

365
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:23,770

 - This is delicious.</font>

371

372
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,740
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">For example, in spring or autumn...</font>

373
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:44,640
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">- Autumn leaves on the mountain. 
 - There will be foliage.</font>

374
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:48,300
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">Plateau where you can walk for mountain climbing.</font>

375
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:50,910

 - Something like that is there, really.</font>

376
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:52,880

377
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,110
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">- Try to shout. 
 - Have you ever shouted 'Yahoo'?</font>

378
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:57,920
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">- A serious Yahoo. 
 - Serious.</font>

379
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,000
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">Shouting out loud. You really want to do it.</font>

380
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,900
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">- It's amazing. 
 - You do not want to.</font>

00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,850
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">Great!</font>

387
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,110
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">- Good, interesting! 
 - Just do it.</font>

420
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:53,370

421
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,400
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">Anime voice acting.</font>

422
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,720
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">- Voice acting? 
 - Yes.</font>

423
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,250
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">Anime voice acting.</font>

00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:02,520
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">I really love anime.</font>

<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">- All the time. 
 - I love Anime all the time.</font>

426
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,920
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">I want to present you this charm of anime voice acting.</font>

427
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:14,810
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">I thought I want to set up this activity today.</font>

428
00:19:14,810 --> 00:19:17,370
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">Firstly, its main activity is this!</font>

429
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:19,470
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">Voice acting school.</font>

430
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:20,720
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">Well, this exists, doesn't it?</font>

431
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,420
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="31"><b>{\an8}Main activity: Learn the basics by going to the voice acting school.</b></font>

432
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:24,220
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">In here, foundation is necessary in the beginning.</font>

433
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:26,670
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">We are really careful about the voice.</font>

434
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:28,490
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">- You're doing it right. 
 - Properly.</font>

435
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:30,960
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">- Are you studying? 
 - Well, really.</font>

436
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:35,630
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">It's really possible that you get a job from this activity.</font>

437
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:39,500
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">But to be honest with you...</font>

438
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:43,740
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">Even everyone who is really talented is auditioned.</font>

439
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:48,910
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">In the audition, it won't get you an exact certain role.</font>

440
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:52,970
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">There are a lot of people who really aim at this.</font>

441
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:55,450
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">It is said that only 1% can be a voice actor.</font>

442
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:59,320
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">There a very narrow chance to be a voice actor as it's only 1%.</font>

443
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:01,400
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">So firstly, let's start with the basics.</font>

444
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,530
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">I do not know if one of you might be voice actress in the future.</font>

445
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:08,670
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">Even if that is not the case, there may be a possibility that someone might have that voice.</font>

446
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:10,600
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">- I think it would be good if you do this. 
 - Yes.</font>

447
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,500
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">In order to know the charm of the voice acting here, let's do dubbing impromptu challenge!</font>

448
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:16,780
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">Voice acting improvisation challenge!</font>

449
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,490
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">Heidi role of "Heidi, Girl of the Alps"</font>

450
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:23,980
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">Dubbing Heidi role in this scene from "Heidi, Girl of the Alps"</font>

451
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:29,340
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">Well, then, I'd really like to try dubbing this scene.</font>

452
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:31,530
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">But probably you're not interested.</font>

453
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:33,820
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">- Well, first, Himura-san. 
 - I want to do it.</font>

456
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:37,560
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">Heidi!?</font>

457
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:41,180
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">- Not the old man? 
 - Yes, Heidi's voice.</font>

458
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,140
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">Himura-san is famous for producing various voices.</font>

459
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:44,560
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">- That's right. 
 - Right!</font>

00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:47,140
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="36">Really! You voiced in Minions.</font>

461
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:48,090
