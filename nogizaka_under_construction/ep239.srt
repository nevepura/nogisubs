00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,600
I want to check the suction

558
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,860
sugoi~ I can't pull away

559
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,680
Can't pull away can you

560
00:23:54,680 --> 00:24:00,170
That would make your heart race...that "I can't pull away"

561
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:01,640
what? Tamaki-san?

562

[ *Still checking the suction ]

563
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:06,970
Are you trying to turn me into Tamaki-san with that?

564
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:12,550
Is this really Tamaki-san?

[ Random character ]

I can't see it but its likely not him

567
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,430
But this one is 20,000 yen

568
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:20,660
It all goes in here?

569
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:22,220
How do you empty the dirt?

570
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,460
With this you could drop the dirt right into a trash can

571
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:27,600
That's mega convenient

572
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,680
Way too easy

573
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,210
Next the group

574
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:35,290
is moving into the robot vacuum section

575
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:39,270
They have this many models of robot vacuums?

576
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:40,620
There's a bunch of them but

577
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:44,470
some of them can be really loud

578
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:46,710
The ones that go WHRRNNG

579
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:47,300
ah you know this?

580
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:50,330
Recently it seems like Shiraishi Mai-chan has a robot vacuum

581
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:52,660
but its so loud it makes you wonder if its worth it

582
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:54,860
I want the type that shoots out water

583
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:55,920
That's over there

584
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,760
But I think those just wipe the floor

585
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,780
Those are mopping robots

586
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:04,780
But if you find yourself mopping everyday then its fine

587
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:06,220
I have a mopping robot at home

00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:08,250
I see...then its these over here

589
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:11,660
About 32,000 yen

590
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:14,250
It uses a crazy amount of vibration where it mops

591
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:18,200
It rolls along and leaves everything shiny

592
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:20,300
I want to try it

Everything turns shiny

594
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:25,190
So shiny you can see your reflection in the floor

595
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:28,100
If that's so..since its so cheap get one of those along with the Shark

596
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:31,430
If you get them together that's just around 50,000

597
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:32,820
That would work out well

598
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:34,230
Can I do that?

599
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:36,070
Of course...its your reward location shoot
