yes yes yes yes

567
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:37,540
uwah...why couldn't you have rolled up your sleeves more

568
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:39,460
Gotta have the sleeves higher for this

569
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:46,140
Ikuta's smile seems completely inappropriate for this situation

570
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:47,190
Its falling! Its falling!

571
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:48,520
OUT!

572
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,740
[ Kubo is eliminated ]

573
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:52,840
Ikuta gets the victory

574
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,330
What was that?

575
00:23:58,330 --> 00:24:00,660
now then Ikuta..what you've been waiting for

576
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:02,900
[ 1st members get a coin ]

577
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,580
The 1s did it

578
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:05,640

581
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:09,160
That was an incredible battle

582
00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:12,140
Ikuta..how's the teeth? Properly back under your lips?

583
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:13,860
I'm fine...teeth are a little dried out though...
