<font size="46"><b>Alright then, Himura-san.</b></font>

5
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:25,500
<font size="46"><b>Yes.</b></font>

00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:43,280
<font size="46"><b>As stated, this time, we have here someone who loves unfortunate stories even more than her daily three meals.</b></font>

9
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:52,030
<font size="46"><b>In the past, when Ikuta suffered a broken bone and couldn't participate in their hit campaign prayer...</b></font>

10
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:56,770
<font size="46"><b>Hashimoto, who loves unfortunate stories, was found heartily laughing by herself.</b></font>

11
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:01,050
<font size="46"><b>Well, I do actually find these stories funny...</b></font>

12
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:03,720
<font size="46"><b>But I also think that precisely because it's unfortunate, if nobody laughs about these stories,</b></font>

13
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,480
<font size="46"><b>then they really become unfortunate... Right?</b></font>

14
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,210
<font size="46"><b>Ah, I see.</b></font>

15
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:08,370
<font size="46"><b>So it's laughter that wells up from kindness.</b></font>

16
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:09,150
<font size="46"><b>Really now?</b></font>

17
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:09,740
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="44">Really now?</font>

18
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:11,020
<font size="46"><b>Really, really!</b></font>

19
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:12,740
<font size="46"><b>So, then, today...</b></font>

20
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:15,890
<font size="46"><b>We'll have members share their own unfortunate stories themselves.</b></font>

21
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,890

31
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:37,210
<font size="46"><b>Unfortunate and funny.</b></font>

32
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:38,660

33
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:42,380

36
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:47,500

37
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,020
<font size="46"><b>That's seriously the worst.</b></font>

38
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:55,550
<font size="46"><b>So what's important here is that... Your story should not put off Hashimoto-sensei even if it's unfortunate.</b></font>

39
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:56,900
<font size="46"><b>Like if it's just too unfortunate.</b></font>

40
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,160
<font size="46"><b>A merry story would be best.</b></font>

41
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,380
<font size="46"><b>So you'd prefer merry.</b></font>

42
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:00,160
<font size="46"><b>Yes.</b></font>

46
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:17,270
<font size="46"><b>So then I got home and I thought I'd take out the things I bought and opened my luggage bag.</b></font>

47
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:22,180
<font size="46"><b>And then, I was surprised to find that my bag had become pure white.</b></font>

48
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:24,450
<font size="46"><b>I thought something must have gotten spilled.</b></font>

49
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:25,220
<font size="46"><b>When you opened it?</b></font>

50
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:28,020
<font size="46"><b>Yes. I thought "Scary~ Scary~".</b></font>

<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="44">Ghost story?</font>

<font size="46"><b>Huh?</b></font>

53
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:30,400
<font size="46"><b>Huh? Hm?</b></font>

54
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,730

55
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:38,340
<font size="46"><b>Then when I looked for what got spilled, it was the body cream I bought for myself.</b></font>

56
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:41,800
<font size="46"><b>There was really little left of it.</b></font>

57
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:49,380
<font size="46"><b>I wondered why... But then I thought I did want to try it, so one day, I looked at it. I wanted to know what it smelled like and all.</b></font>

58
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:51,780
<font size="46"><b>And then when I looked at it...</b></font>

59
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:54,500
<font size="46"><b>Tester. It was labeled "Tester".</b></font>

60
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:58,010
<font size="46"><b>So you ended up buying the tester.</b></font>

61
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:01,450
<font size="46"><b>I made a mistake and did I buy the tester?</b></font>

62
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:03,160
<font size="46"><b>Ah, wrong words.</b></font>

63
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,160
<font size="46"><b>Why a question?</b></font>

64
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,170
<font size="46"><b>"Did I buy it?" What happened?</b></font>

65
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:10,440
<font size="46"><b>That's funny.</b></font>

66
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:14,110
<font size="46"><b>Once in the middle of your story... Was that Inagawa-san? Inakawa Junji-san.</b></font>

67
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,660
<font size="46"><b>You said "Scary~", right?</b></font>

68
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:19,300
<font size="46"><b>Not "Scary~" but "Scary~ Scary~". You said it twice, right?</b></font>

69
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,640
<font size="46"><b>That's Inagawa-san's trademark line though.</b></font>

70
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,760
<font size="46"><b>I did it unconsciously...</b></font>

71
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:23,660
<font size="46"><b>Unconsciously, I see.</b></font>

72
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:24,080
<font size="46"><b>You alright?</b></font>

73
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:24,540
<font size="46"><b>Yes.</b></font>

74
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:30,200
<font size="46"><b>An unfortunate story from Guam... How will Hashimoto-sensei rate it?</b></font>

75
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,880
<font size="46"><b>Between funny and not, it would be on the funny side.</b></font>

76
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:35,090
<font size="46"><b>Around here...</b></font>

77
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:36,930
<font size="46"><b>Oh! That's kind of good, right?</b></font>

78
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:37,720
<font size="46"><b>Pretty good.</b></font>

79
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,560
<font size="46"><b>Yeah, this is a funny misfortune.</b></font>

80
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:44,140
<font size="46"><b>Unfortunate Stories Grand Prix. Next up is Ikuta.</b></font>

81
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:47,770
<font size="46"><b>The title is: Skating Lesson Tragedy.</b></font>

82
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:51,410
<font size="46"><b>This is a story from when I was in my second grade of elementary school.</b></font>

83
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:55,910
<font size="46"><b>At the time, the figure skater Asada Mao-chan was very popular.</b></font>

84
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:58,470
<font size="46"><b>I was little then and I admired her.</b></font>

85
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:04,440
<font size="46"><b>And then, with all that, there happened to be a poster in my hometown that said "Taking applications for skating classes".</b></font>

86
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:07,930
<font size="46"><b>So then I thought I wanted to try this and was going to do so with a friend.</b></font>

87
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:15,450
<font size="46"><b>So on the first day, my father was going to be taking me to that class on his bicycle.</b></font>

88
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:16,500
<font size="46"><b>So it was close?</b></font>

89
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,410
<font size="46"><b>Yes.</b></font>

90
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:19,940
<font size="46"><b>But I was really, really excited.</b></font>

91
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:22,940
<font size="46"><b>I was just so fired up and hyper.</b></font>

92
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:24,980
<font size="46"><b>The main focus would be this foot of mine here.</b></font>

93
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:25,940
<font size="46"><b>Focus on the foot.</b></font>

94
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:30,200
<font size="46"><b>Yes. So as I rode on the bike, I was going "I'm so excited~" and going like this excitedly on our way there.</b></font>

95
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:33,790
<font size="46"><b>And this foot here got pulled in with the wheel...</b></font>

96
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:35,090
<font size="46"><b>Ow, ow, ow!</b></font>

97
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:36,720
<font size="46"><b>She's laughing. She's laughing.</b></font>

98
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,700
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="44">Good rating <font color="#f6a8c6">❤</font></font>

99
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:38,500
<font size="46"><b>She's laughing alright.</b></font>

100
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,160
<font size="46"><b>Is this the funny part?</b></font>

101
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,060
<font size="46"><b>And I then broke a bone in my foot.</b></font>

102
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:42,880
<font size="46"><b>Again?</b></font>

103
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:43,540
<font size="46"><b>Yes.</b></font>

104
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:44,290
<font size="46"><b>Broken bone again?</b></font>

105
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:45,540
<font size="46"><b>Not so much again as that was the original.</b></font>

106
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:46,970
<font size="46"><b>Ah, yes, I see.</b></font>

107
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:48,400
<font size="46"><b>She's laughing really hard.</b></font>

108
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,160
<font size="46"><b>Yes. So then, of course, I couldn't go attend the skating class.</b></font>

109
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,840
<font size="46"><b>And, from then on, well, I... I've never skated even once.</b></font>

110
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,080
<font size="46"><b>You've never skated since then.</b></font>

111
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,570
<font size="46"><b>Never.</b></font>

112
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:04,240
<font size="46"><b>It's pretty amazing to break your foot on your way to class.</b></font>

113
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,350
<font size="46"><b>Yes!</b></font>

114
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:07,950
<font size="46"><b>The more recent one where you dropped the detergent was your foot as well, right?</b></font>

115
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:09,900
<font size="46"><b>Oh, that one was toe.</b></font>

116
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:13,730
<font size="46"><b>And for this time... I mean for the original incident, it was my ankle.</b></font>

117
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:15,720
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="44">Ankle Fracture</font>

118
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,100
<font size="46"><b>Which ankle?</b></font>

119
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:17,920
<font size="46"><b>The left one.</b></font>

120
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,300
<font size="46"><b>Was it a comminuted fracture for your left ankle?</b></font>

121
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:24,090
<font size="46"><b>It wasn't comminuted, but it somehow got broken...</b></font>

122
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:26,530
<font size="46"><b>Sounds painful, right?</b></font>

123
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:27,370
<font size="46"><b>Sounds terrible.</b></font>

124
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:28,050
<font size="46"><b>And you're laughing, right?</b></font>

125
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:28,740
<font size="46"><b>She's laughing.</b></font>

126
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:32,620
<font size="46"><b>In contrast, Nishino has been trying not to listen anymore.</b></font>

127
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:34,750
<font size="46"><b>I'm really bad with stories that involve pain.</b></font>

128
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,120
<font size="46"><b>So you're bad with painful stories.</b></font>

129
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:36,980
<font size="46"><b>It's hard to listen to, right?</b></font>

130
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,580
<font size="46"><b>Hashimoto-sensei, though, was laughing a lot.</b></font>

131
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:42,450
<font size="46"><b>She was already laughing even during the part where Ikuta was waving her legs.</b></font>

133
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:44,300

134
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:48,460
<font size="46"><b>How long did it take to heal?</b></font>

135
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:51,460
<font size="46"><b>Around one year.</b></font>

136
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:53,100
<font size="46"><b>I couldn't move freely for that long.</b></font>

137
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,710

189
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:06,300
<font size="46"><b>People around me would ask, "What happened to the black part?".</b></font>

190

193

<font size="46"><b>Next, back in elementary school, we had those arithmetic sets, didn't we?</b></font>

194

<font size="46"><b>Oh yeah, I remember!</b></font>

195

196
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:24,020
<font size="46"><b>Mine was a hand-me-down as well.</b></font>

197
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:27,020
<font size="46"><b>And, well, it was 8 years old...</b></font>

198
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:28,720
<font size="46"><b>So there were these sticks used for counting.</b></font>

199
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,960
<font size="46"><b>And we used these sticks to form shapes and stuff.</b></font>

200
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:36,440
<font size="46"><b>So, everyone else's was new, of course.</b></font>

201
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:40,590
<font size="46"><b>So their sticks could be put together, attached to each other...</b></font>

202
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:43,770
<font size="46"><b>But mine could only be lined up.</b></font>

204
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,380

<font size="46"><b>Yes.</b></font>

206
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:51,580

207
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:55,510
<font size="46"><b>"Alright everyone, why don't we take these sticks and form a 3-dimensional figure?"</b></font>

208
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:56,680
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="44">A cruel question.</font>

209
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,520
<font size="46"><b>So 3D, huh?</b></font>

210
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:02,180
<font size="46"><b>They can't be attached to each other. They can't form 3D.</b></font>

211
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:07,210
<font size="46"><b>So I told the teacher that I could only do flat figures, and I ended up being the only one behind in class.</b></font>

212
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:09,500
<font size="46"><b>You should've just taped them together.</b></font>

213
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:14,680
<font size="46"><b>Yeah, that was my only choice. So, there was that.</b></font>

214
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,600
<font size="46"><b>Kind of heartbreaking.</b></font>

215
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,670
<font size="46"><b>She's reacting. Hashimoto-san's reacting.</b></font>

216
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:19,140
<font size="46"><b>She's laughing hard.</b></font>

217
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:21,200
<font size="46"><b>"That girl's stuck with flat figures!"</b></font>

218
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,210
<font size="46"><b>So aside from those, we had a sewing kit in elementary right?</b></font>

219
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,100
<font size="46"><b>My sewing scissors were clearly bigger than others.</b></font>

220
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:31,310
<font size="46"><b>It was all rusted and kind of black too.</b></font>

221
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:35,340
<font size="46"><b>And on top of that, it didn't match the size of my sewing kit so it would protrude out of the box.</b></font>

222
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:37,320
<font size="46"><b>It wouldn't fit.</b></font>

223
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:42,690
<font size="46"><b>So then, I got questions again. "Why is that black? Why is it big?".</b></font>

224
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:44,870
<font size="46"><b>And why is the one asking stupid?</b></font>

225
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:46,020
<font size="46"><b>What's with that person?</b></font>

226
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:49,850
<font size="46"><b>I replied "Ah, I don't know, but somehow it's big and black..."</b></font>

227
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:54,010
<font size="46"><b>But I thought the worst one was the Melodion one.</b></font>

228
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:54,710
<font size="46"><b>Melodion?</b></font>

229
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:57,150
<font size="46"><b>Oh, I guess that's not what it's usually called... I meant the key harmonica.</b></font>

231
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:01,750
<font size="46"><b>You call that melodion?</b></font>

232
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,360
<font size="46"><b>Yes, we call it melodion.</b></font>

233
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,370
<font size="46"><b>Seriously?</b></font>

234
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:05,240
<font size="46"><b>What the heck's a melodion?</b></font>

235
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:05,750
<font size="46"><b>Amazing, huh?</b></font>

236
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,050
<font size="46"><b>Yes, melodion.</b></font>

237
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:07,560
<font size="46"><b>Melodion.</b></font>

238
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,080
<font size="46"><b>You play it like this, right?</b></font>

239
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:13,560
<font size="46"><b>Yes. For the melodion, I probably got the one from my brother.</b></font>

240
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:17,160
<font size="46"><b>So, it had his name written at the back in large characters.</b></font>

241
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,560
<font size="46"><b>And when I looked at it more closely, the the part you put in your mouth had bite marks.</b></font>

242
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:22,100
<font size="46"><b>Ah! Inoue's making a face!</b></font>

243
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:24,900
<font size="46"><b>He was a guy, so I guess he bit it.</b></font>

244
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:27,910
<font size="46"><b>It had lots of bite marks.</b></font>

245
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:32,740
<font size="46"><b>I was quite troubled, and in the end, I did get a new one bought for me... Just the part here.</b></font>

246
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:32,740
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="44">Limited to replacement parts.</font>

247
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:35,280
<font size="46"><b>Oh, so just that part? What about the main body?</b></font>

248
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:38,020
<font size="46"><b>Oh, well, the main part was still usable so I was told to just keep using it.</b></font>

249
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:42,790

250
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:44,290

<font size="46"><b>Eh? Your school uniform too?</b></font>

252
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:45,790
<font size="46"><b>Yes.</b></font>

253
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:50,040

254
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:56,370
<font size="46"><b>So during the opening ceremony, someone asked me... "Hey, the cloth of your uniform... Isn't it kinda' thin?"</b></font>

260
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:07,160
<font size="46"><b>So there were small changes?</b></font>

261
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:10,600
<font size="46"><b>Yeah, there were small changes, like whether there was a lining or not and all.</b></font>

262
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:14,190
<font size="46"><b>There were changes like that, and I kept getting asked about it.</b></font>

263

<font size="46"><b>You kept getting hand-me-downs huh.</b></font>

264
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:16,460
<font size="46"><b>So it's like that.</b></font>

265
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:18,570

307
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:07,410

<font size="46"><b>Yes.</b></font>

309
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:12,000
<font size="46"><b>This is a story around that time. So, I was playing on the swings with my friend.</b></font>

310
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,650
<font size="46"><b>And there was another friend with us, just watching. There were only 2 swings.</b></font>

311
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:21,480
<font size="46"><b>So, just playing on the swings were kinda' not enough for us...</b></font>

312
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:24,480
<font size="46"><b>So, it has those rings, right? So, those rings...</b></font>

313
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:25,460
<font size="46"><b>The ones here?</b></font>

314

<font size="46"><b>Yes, those.</b></font>

315
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:27,250
<font size="46"><b>The links, you mean?</b></font>

316
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:32,640
<font size="46"><b>So we kinda' crumpled those links together, then let go.</b></font>

317
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,930
<font size="46"><b>Yeah, we did that too.</b></font>

318
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:36,210
<font size="46"><b>We did that!</b></font>

319
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:37,240
<font size="46"><b>It's like you roll them up.</b></font>

320
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:37,930
<font size="46"><b>Yeah.</b></font>

321
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:39,360
<font size="46"><b>Sure, we did that.</b></font>

322
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,680
<font size="46"><b>So we did that, crumpling them and letting go. And we had fun.</b></font>

323
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:48,700
<font size="46"><b>So then, somehow, only my swing went back to normal, and my friend's just stayed like that.</b></font>

324
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:53,190
<font size="46"><b>So we thought it would just get fixed and we went home, leaving it like that.</b></font>

325
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:57,080
<font size="46"><b>The next morning, during the morning assembly...</b></font>

326
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:04,560
<font size="46"><b>A teacher said "Everyone, I have something to talk about with you. Yesterday, the swing got broken."</b></font>

00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,480
<font size="46"><b>You guys did it right?</b></font>

330
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,010
<font size="46"><b>I thought that was us, so, for the time being, I stood up.</b></font>

331
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:14,610
<font size="46"><b>Oh, how impressive.</b></font>

332
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:17,420
<font size="46"><b>So I stood up. So we were asked "Who broke it?"</b></font>

333
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:19,840
<font size="46"><b>It wasn't exactly me...</b></font>

334

335

341

<font size="46"><b>Oh, so you said so? You talked back?</b></font>

344

345

351
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:04,120
<font size="46"><b>Yes. So then, that guy said, "I also saw Kazumi-chan do it!"</b></font>

358
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:19,060

359
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:23,270
<font size="46"><b>Then the teacher also said, "Kazumi-chan, you did it, didn't you?"</b></font>

408

424
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:04,330
<font size="46"><b>Yes, it does!</b></font>

425
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:05,510

426
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:09,640

428

<font size="46"><b>It disappears.</b></font>

451
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:31,090
