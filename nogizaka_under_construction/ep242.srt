550
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:29,500
ever since I was little

551
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,950
she'd take me to all kinds of places

552
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:33,380
But since joining Nogizaka

553
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:36,720
days off are maybe only 1 or 2 days

554
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,450
so we don't travel much anymore

555
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:41,220
I'll work really hard in Nogizaka

556
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:42,150
and give her a present

557
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:42,780
That's right

558
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:44,760
nice story

559
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:57,060
Next its the hopes of the Akimoto family

560
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:58,100
eh Akimoto

561
00:22:58,390 --> 00:22:58,740
hai

562
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:00,090
Its from your little brother

563
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:00,950
My brother?

564
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,660
Ever since I was little

565
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:05,380
I've wanted to start a business with her

566
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:06,600
start a business?

567
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:06,950
hai

568
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:09,660
I've been thinking about wanting to work with her

569
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:12,760
Plus he's thought about it since he was little

570
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,730
Together with my sister that I've always loved

571
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:18,100
my dream is to put in the hard effort as we work side by side

572
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:19,450
eh mega kowai

573
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:21,420
I haven't mentioned this yet to my sister so

574
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:23,700
I'm not sure whether she'll like the idea or not

575
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:26,740
If this dream were to come true I wouldn't need anything else in the world

576
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:27,710
ehhh~

577
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:28,780
kawaii

578
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:30,780
Please come and work with me

579
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:31,690
What is this?

580
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:32,740
However...

581
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:34,220
I would be company president

582
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,340
I think he slipped a joke in there

583
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:38,860
That sounds super cute

584
00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:40,800
You sure that's my brother?

585
00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:41,320
Age?

586
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,440
He's 23

587
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,630
Then he's serious about this

588
00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:44,860
eh but still

589
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:45,900
Ever have this conversation before?

590
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:47,210
Not even once

591
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:49,020
But he wrote about wanting this since he was little

592
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:51,320
Since he was little? That's got to be a lie

593
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:52,990
no no

594
00:23:53,290 --> 00:23:55,080
That's not the little brother that I know

595
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:59,880
He wrote "my dream is to put in the hard effort as we work side by side"

596
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:00,730
heh?

597
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:02,150
What's he talking about...

598
00:24:03,130 --> 00:24:04,840
Why are you blushing? Its a good thing

599
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:07,510
That can't be....did my brother really say this?

600
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:09,420
He really loves his big sister

601
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:11,110
You're the sister he's always loved

602
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:12,310
uwah...that reeks of lies

603
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:14,940
no no...he even wrote it down for us

604
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:16,700
What's your brother doing now?

605
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:19,860
Right now this is his first year with a real job

606
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:21,690
Perhaps he hates his job?

607
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:24,140
[ Low job satisfaction? ]

608
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:27,590
Forget this job...I'd rather work with my sister
