And that means

a majority of them did not answer correctly

560
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:09,680
unfortunately this will be her first fall

561
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:11,910
seriously just hold on a second

562
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:14,080
But we have to do this

563
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,390
I really hate the part where I know that I'm going to fall

564
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:17,280
wait!

565
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:20,390
But you could fall several times today

566
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:23,780
ah! I hate this part!

567
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:25,160
How would you like to do this?

568
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,540
For the first fall you can decide how its done

[ Getting toyed with ]

570
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:34,480
Should I just press it or give you an 8-count?

571
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,270
Which is better?

572
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:37,090
I'll take the countdown

573
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:40,660
Too long?

574
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:43,320
Here goes

575
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,160
you'll get 5 seconds

She's all white

HA HA HAAA~

581
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:10,200
Pretty good job of getting covered white

582
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,600
Am I supposed to keep doing this...

583
00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:16,530
Next you'll fall in an egg bath and then finally into panko bread crumbs

[ Flour to eggs to bread crumbs for frying ]

585
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:20,340
Then into boiling hot oil

Every time Akimoto-san does this it highlights her laugh wrinkles and makes her look old

588
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:29,760
yes spread it out to make it a pretty white

589
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:34,150
hey Hori...as far as makeup goes...making wrinkles stick out is bad right

590
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:37,640
that's right...this is the complete opposite of what's currently trendy in makeup

[ Next week its the conclusion of "Celebrate the new Captain Akimoto" ]

592
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:49,590
Now then...she's fallen down 1 time

593
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:50,520
Will she be ok here on out?

594
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:52,940
Please don't allow your captain to fall anymore
