Her kicks are amazing

372
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:10,110
There's a backflip

373
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,690
yabee...he's huge

374
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:16,350
Boss!

375
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:18,470
The boss is powerful

376

yabee

377
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:24,140
The boss is powerful...that guy is ruthless

380

yabee...that's dirty taking her hostage

381
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,400
She's been captured

382
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:28,570
To be continued? Where's the rest?

383
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:29,430
What's this?

384
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:31,000
Is it to be continued?

385
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,310
Its continuing!

386
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:38,360
The boss! Its the boss!

387
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,380
ah the boss escaped

388
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:41,590
What's your problem!

389
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:44,760

Give me back my comrade!

393
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:25,070
She could escape right now

394
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:30,600
ganbare!

395
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,340
What was that move just now?

396
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,040
sugoi sugoi

397
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:00,140
High kick finished him

398
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:01,000
What's happening?

399
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:09,440
Why did the both of them finish him?

400
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,460
Its over?

401
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,660
You did it!

402
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:14,650

403
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:18,220

404
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:20,000
sugoi

405
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,360
So the video brought us to this live performance

406
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:24,880
I get it

407
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,700
So what was the hardest part of that?

408
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,510
It was the wire work

409
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:35,640
Doing the flips and all was really difficult...several times

410
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:39,160
I tried and failed and would get tired

411
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,530
that last part you did in front of us

412
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:43,790
when you simply did this to make your enemy stop..that was amazing

413
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:45,180
That happened for a moment

414
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:46,220
The Boss was like

415
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:51,530
[ imaginary punch? ]

416
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:52,590
That's a spirit punch

417
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:53,840
So its a spirit punch

418
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,950
I get the feeling the Big Boss understood the situation

419
00:23:55,950 --> 00:23:57,680
[ Considerate Boss man ]

420
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,230
Its fine...it was a spirit punch

421
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:00,360
Mostly spirit then

422
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,120
So he performed with you...the Boss

423
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:03,550
Boss!

424
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:06,430
How was she as far as a raw action movie star?

425
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:08,480
Really good reflexes as well as

426
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:12,010
her focus during practice was incredible

427
00:24:12,010 --> 00:24:14,200
She really memorized all the moves

428
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,130
ahhh...eh?!

429
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:16,640
Kakehashi is crying?

430
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,440
I cried a little

431
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,520
You cried?

432
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,340
eh? What emotions caused the crying?

433
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,430
Is it all the effort she put into it?

434
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,920
What's wrong?

435
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,900
What's wrong Kakehashi? Why are you crying?

436
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:32,300
She's gone through that exact same experience before!

437
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:35,230
[ Fought fierce battles in the past? ]

438
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:38,170
You've had to fight a guy with a bazooka before?

439
00:24:38,170 --> 00:24:41,290
I thought Riria-san had been shot

440
00:24:41,290 --> 00:24:42,680
You thought they shot her?

441
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,360
Thought she got shot?

442
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:46,880
Seriously? You're not going to be able to watch any movies then

443
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:50,460
[ This movie is fiction.  It is not based on any real people or events ]

444
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:52,620
That's good though knowing she wasn't shot

445
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:56,960
But we should ask sensei

446
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,000
Taking both scenes into account...the movie plus here in studio

447
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,300
Does she pass or fail? Your judgement please

449
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:05,340
well of course

450
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:06,640
she passed
