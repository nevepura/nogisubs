<font size="70"><b>I see!</b></font>

88
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:21,180

92
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,320

330
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:50,750

553
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,030
<font size="70"><b>You've done various difficult things up until now, huh?</b></font>

554
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:56,400
<font size="70"><b>Yes. They were quite dangerous and also physically exhausting...</b></font>

555
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:03,390
<font size="70"><b>When I climbed Mt. Fuji, a fan told me "If Minami was able to climb it, it must've been a breeze, huh!"</b></font>

556
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:07,810
<font size="70"><b>More than seeing it as difficult, they thought it was pretty easy cuz you were able to climb it.</b></font>

557
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:10,480
<font size="70"><b>They say "Must've been easy!" and all, but we climbed for 13 hours!</b></font>

558

559
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:19,100
<font size="70"><b>Of course, there's no way we could air the entire 13 hours, after all.</b></font>

560
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:19,890
<font size="70"><b>Yeah, can't have that.</b></font>

561
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:25,520
<font size="70"><b>Yes, but because of that, people get the idea that it was a really easy climb.</b></font>

562
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,320
<font size="70"><b>So you think that the difficulty doesn't get through.</b></font>

563
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:33,260
<font size="70"><b>Yes. So with the timing of this activity, we can all go get a massage for a smaller face, or to a therapist...</b></font>

564
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:34,100
<font size="70"><b>I want to go!</b></font>

565

567
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:36,910
<font size="70"><b>To make ourselves cute.</b></font>

568
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:41,680
<font size="70"><b>So we'll go to a therapist and become cuter and have fans like us even more...</b></font>

569
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:42,750
<font size="70" color="#d9c9e5"><b>And with that we'll be able to do our hit prayer.</b></font>

570
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:47,570
<font size="70"><b>I see. So even when you do extreme things, the difficulty doesn't get through anyway...</b></font>

571
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:52,990
<font size="70"><b>So, then it'll be more useful for the sales if you just become cuter and it's better to just do that.</b></font>

579
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:07,690
<font size="70"><b>So then we go to a therapist...</b></font>

580
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:13,090
<font size="70"><b>And if everyone gets good maintenance for their bodies, their dance will become better as well.</b></font>

595
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:46,590

596
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:49,140
<font size="70"><b>I did get a great sense of accomplishment.</b></font>

597
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:54,870
<font size="70"><b>But, it's true, there were parts here and there that didn't get through. Also the way back? The way down...</b></font>

00:22:54,870 --> 00:23:00,630
<font size="70"><b>Unexpectedly, it was more difficult than going up, but then the cameras weren't even rolling.</b></font>

604
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:16,510
<font size="70"><b>I do get that. I get that you were walking even when you weren't on cam and that going down was difficult as well.</b></font>

<font size="70"><b>Will everyone do this one?</b></font>

606
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:25,070
<font size="70"><b>Yes... Or after doing something that someone else thought of, we'll go do this...</b></font>
