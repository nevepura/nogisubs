00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:04,050
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Huh?</font>

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
<font face="Georgia" size="43">The world only Kawago knows</font>

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:13,000
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Hello, my name is Hironobu Komiya from Sanshiro</font>

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Behind me are some members from Nogizaka46!</font>

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,800
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Yeaaah (*^▽^*) Nice to meet you</font>

7
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,570
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Nice to mee~t you</font>

8
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:26,200
<font face="Georgia" size="43">I only made them laugh by greeting them...</font>

9
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:31,170
<font face="Georgia" size="43">So, our teacher for tonight is Hina Kawago</font>

10
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,640
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Nice to meet you!</font>

11
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:37,950
<font face="Georgia" size="43">This may be prompt but, Komiya-San, do you like Idols?</font>

12
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:39,490
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Yes, I like them.</font>

13
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:42,490
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Oh, so you like them? Who for example?</font>

14
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:43,490
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Yoko Oginome for example</font>

15
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:46,490
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Rough choice</font>

16
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:49,660
<font face="Georgia" size="43">I also really like idols from the past but..</font>

17
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:52,570
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Oh, so you really like idols in general?</font>

18
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:55,570
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Yes, I like idols but not from a simple point of view</font>

19
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:58,300
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Today, this is our subejct</font>

20
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:02,910
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Things only Kawago knows about: The world of Miss iD</font>

21
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:03,910
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Miss ID?</font>

22
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:05,410
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Oh, you don't know it yet?</font>

23
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:06,880
<font face="Georgia" size="43">I don't know it</font>

24
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:12,350
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Miss ID originally was "Miss Magazine"</font>

25
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:16,350
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Miss Magazine was started in 1982. It was a contest for beautiful girls. It was won by people like Yuki Saito, Kana Kurashina or Kie Kitano</font>

26
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:21,190
<font face="Georgia" size="43">From our members Eto won the last one of the contests</font>

27
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:25,900
<font face="Georgia" size="43">The finalists</font>

28
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,770
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Eto-San?</font>

29
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:29,740
<font face="Georgia" size="43">I'm not Eto-San</font>

30
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:30,710
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Eto is not here</font>

31
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:37,710
<font face="Georgia" size="43">This girl also entered the contest before joining Nogizaka46. She was one of the 15 finalists.</font>

32
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:43,510
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Since then, Miss Magazine became Miss iD</font>

33
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:48,020
<font face="Georgia" size="43">The contest has been held 3 times</font>

34
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:50,520
<font face="Georgia" size="43">It's like a usual Idol audition where it's ok if you don't dance or sing</font>

35
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:52,230
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Anyways, anythink is okay</font>

36
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:55,230
<font face="Georgia" size="43">You can be just funny and that's okay</font>

37
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:58,530
<font face="Georgia" size="43">So it's like M-1 Grand-Prix? [a famous Manzai competition]</font>

38
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:00,530
<font face="Georgia" size="43">A comedy festival?</font>

39
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:04,900
<font face="Georgia" size="43">The first time it was done in 2013.</font>

40
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:06,540
<font face="Georgia" size="43">The winner of that year was this person</font>

41
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:09,940
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Tina Tamashiro</font>

42
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:10,940
<font face="Georgia" size="43">I have seen her before..</font>

43
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:13,850
<font face="Georgia" size="43">She is extremely talented</font>

44
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:14,580
<font face="Georgia" size="43"></font>

45
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,580
<font face="Georgia" size="43">It wasn't yet decided if it should be really called a grand prix</font>

46
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:19,650
<font face="Georgia" size="43">But because of her, it was called a Grand Prix. She is that astonishing!</font>

47
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:27,430
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Tina Tamashiro more than the other candidates made them call the contest a grand prix.</font>

48
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:33,970
<font face="Georgia" size="43">It would have been fine to call it a grand prix from the start</font>

49
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:36,940
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Fundamental issue</font>

50
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:39,940
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Now she models exclusively for ViVi magazine</font>

51
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:43,000
<font face="Georgia" size="43">She's an orthodox model</font>

52
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:48,280
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Usually, I don't really Idols that have a ordinary cuteness to them</font>

53
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:52,880
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Tonight, the idols I will present to you all have something in common.</font>

54
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:56,850
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Bad habits and darker sides</font>

55
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,390
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Now, we're going quiet deep into it, right?</font>

56
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:01,360
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Yeah, right now we're going deep into it</font>

57
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,360
<font face="Georgia" size="43">I like weird habits and darker aspects of idols</font>

58
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,970
<font face="Georgia" size="43">I prefer Idols who say 'I have a boyfriend'</font>

59
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:11,970
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Is there anyone who has a boyfriend now? In Nogizaka..</font>

60
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,200
<font face="Georgia" size="43">In Nogizaka46 it's not allowed..</font>

61
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:16,740
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Of these 5, who has a boyfriend right now?</font>

62
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:19,710
<font face="Georgia" size="43">There are no boyfriends  (*≧▽≦)</font>

63
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:23,710
<font face="Georgia" size="43">But with Miss iD, a lot of the girls have dark and weird sides to them</font>

64
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:27,880
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Today I will present my own selection of participants</font>

65
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:30,090
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Oh, sounds interesting</font>

66
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:33,020
<font face="Georgia" size="43">This is the first girl I want to show you</font>

67
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:36,300
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Rie Kaneko</font>

68
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:40,270
<font face="Georgia" size="43">First of all, here looks are cute right?</font>

69
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:44,270
<font face="Georgia" size="43">She's the winner of the 2015 Grand Prix</font>

70
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:47,070
<font face="Georgia" size="43">There are the winners but from those 2..</font>

71
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:49,280
<font face="Georgia" size="43">So it's called a 'Grand Prix' after all</font>

72
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,280
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Grand Prix Madness</font>

73
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:56,620
<font face="Georgia" size="43">This girl is cute in a usual way</font>

74
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:58,620
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Yeah, she's cute!</font>

75
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:01,650
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Her style is good too, but..</font>

76
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:06,650
<font face="Georgia" size="43">What's special about her is, she was 8 hours late for her final audition.</font>

77
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:09,530
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Huh, what!?</font>

78
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:12,300
<font face="Georgia" size="43">You don't do that, right?</font>

79
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,600
<font face="Georgia" size="43">So why was she late?</font>

80
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:19,070
<font face="Georgia" size="43">She was sleeping</font>

81
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:22,940
<font face="Georgia" size="43">That's what you call proper oversleeping</font>

82
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:22,940
<font face="Georgia" size="43">That's what you call proper oversleeping</font>

83
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:25,610
<font face="Georgia" size="43">So after 8 hours she said 'I'm coming now'</font>

84
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:32,610
<font face="Georgia" size="43">She was told to wake up early the next day and come again to the audition</font>

85
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,120
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Even though she was late she made an impact</font>

86
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:39,090
<font face="Georgia" size="43">The evening the day before, at the place where set the alarm clock, she was acting out a play scene by herself</font>

87
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:42,730
<font face="Georgia" size="43">It was a fight about why her father didn't wake her up in time. With that act she came back to the audition</font>

88
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:46,730
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Like on the telephone or what?</font>

89
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:53,040
<font face="Georgia" size="43">She has courage like that</font>

90
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:57,210
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Now what I like most about her</font>

91
00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:02,210
<font face="Georgia" size="43">A woman hated by other women</font>

92
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:03,980
<font face="Georgia" size="43">So she's like a girl who tries really hard to act cute?</font>

93
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:05,950
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Yeah, she's a girl.</font>

94
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:07,950
<font face="Georgia" size="43"> Confirmed that she's a girl?</font>

95
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,920
<font face="Georgia" size="43">She put in the wrong words in the formular</font>

96
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:17,630
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Her face is cute but she naturally looks like she wants to flirt, you know what I mean?</font>

97
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
<font face="Georgia" size="43">We also have that among our members</font>

98
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:24,940
<font face="Georgia" size="43">For example, there's that girl called Manatsu</font>

99
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:26,940
<font face="Georgia" size="43">'That' girl Manatsu</font>

100
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:36,950
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Because Rie's face is Chihuahuah~ish, white and her eyes are round</font>

101
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:38,450
<font face="Georgia" size="43">You're pretty prejucided..</font>

102
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:40,750
<font face="Georgia" size="43">But that's what I like about her</font>

103
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:43,590
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Please show some film of her</font>

104
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:46,090
<font face="Georgia" size="43">So what did you do today?</font>

105
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:46,590
<font face="Georgia" size="43"> Judge</font>

106
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:50,500
<font face="Georgia" size="43">I slept...</font>

107
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,500
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Even though you had this audition you only slept?</font>

108
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:55,370
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Yes</font>

109
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:59,640
<font face="Georgia" size="43">I will make a fool's blanket</font>

110
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,610
<font face="Georgia" size="43"></font>

111
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:04,610
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Wait!</font>

112
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:07,340
<font face="Georgia" size="43">You are the worst!</font>

113
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:09,120
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Papa, why didn't you wake me up!?</font>

114
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,720
<font face="Georgia" size="43">That really sucks. I don't know what to do..</font>

115
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:16,020
<font face="Georgia" size="43">So, could her good qualities be conveyed?</font>

116
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:18,090
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Everybody, what do you think?</font>

117
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:20,160
<font face="Georgia" size="43">I interrupt</font>

118
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,160
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Change of direction</font>

119
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:26,000
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Because this show revolves around me!</font>

120
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,500
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Center Pride</font>

121
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:30,770
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Next up is this girl</font>

122
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:34,370
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Rei Kuroyima</font>

123
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:37,010
<font face="Georgia" size="43">She's only 14</font>

124
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:41,380
<font face="Georgia" size="43">In her final inspection she played guitar in a swimsuit</font>

125
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:47,580
<font face="Georgia" size="43">At 14, she brought a guitar and a swimsuit by herself</font>

126
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:52,460
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Asuka went to the Nogizaka46 audition when she was 13 years old</font>

127
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:55,630
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Because somebody told me "Just do it!"</font>

128
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:02,890
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Crosses?</font>

129
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:05,940
<font face="Georgia" size="43">What I really like about this girl is this:</font>

130
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:09,810
<font face="Georgia" size="43">She's awfully cheeky</font>

131
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:14,380
<font face="Georgia" size="43">She's constantly has this attitude where she's looking down at you</font>

132
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:20,280
<font face="Georgia" size="43">At 14, it's ok not to focus on the body</font>

133
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:24,820
<font face="Georgia" size="43">This was her final examination so you should be really nervous</font>

134
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,760
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Now let's look at a clip of her's</font>

135
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:30,030
<font face="Georgia" size="43">I'm 13 and I'm doing gravure.</font>

136
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:39,130
<font face="Georgia" size="43">My hobbies are playing the guitar, singing and drawing.</font>

137
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:41,670
<font face="Georgia" size="43">That's all</font>

138
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:43,110
<font face="Georgia" size="43">We have about a minute left.</font>

139
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,080
<font face="Georgia" size="43">What!?</font>

140
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,480
<font face="Georgia" size="43">You don't need it?</font>

141
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:46,580
<font face="Georgia" size="43">You don't need it?</font>

142
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:48,580
<font face="Georgia" size="43">I don't need it, man!</font>

143
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,120
<font face="Georgia" size="43">She's tweeting stuff like 'I hate adults'</font>

144
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:02,290
<font face="Georgia" size="43">With no regard for her fans or relations, she will just say what's on her mind</font>

145
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,930
<font face="Georgia" size="43">But I'm also like that..</font>

146
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:07,930
<font face="Georgia" size="43">I can do that perfectly</font>

147
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:09,770
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Up next is this girl</font>

148
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:13,270
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Aonami Jun</font>

149
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,440
<font face="Georgia" size="43">This girl has an overwhelming aura!</font>

150
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:27,380
<font face="Georgia" size="43">I have done a lot of photo shoots with girls from Miss iD and talked to them a lot during the shoots.</font>

151
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,920
<font face="Georgia" size="43">I talked to them alone at events..</font>

152
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:35,190
<font face="Georgia" size="43">When I had a photo shoot with Jun-Chan, I tried to talk to her..</font>

153
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:37,930
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Her aura was overwhelming</font>

154
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:42,700
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Even though she's younger than me, I couldn't say a word</font>

155
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:44,700
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Do we have a clip?</font>

156
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,800
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Yes, we have one. Please have a look.</font>

157
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:49,510
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Hello, I'm Aonami Jun.</font>

158
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:55,280
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Today, the filming was very embarrassing.</font>

159
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:57,950
<font face="Georgia" size="43">My future dream is</font>

160
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,820
<font face="Georgia" size="43">to buy a house in Germany and to live in Germany.</font>

161
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:06,830
<font face="Georgia" size="43">She always looks like she's not motivated at all</font>

162
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:08,500
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Her voice was extremely tiny..</font>

163
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:11,000
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Try hard to breathe from your stomach!</font>

164
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,030
<font face="Georgia" size="43">That expressionless cuteness, it's really natural, right?</font>

165
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:15,870
<font face="Georgia" size="43">I like that about her!</font>

166
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:17,940
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Next up is this girl!</font>

167
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:21,370
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Shizu Mizuno</font>

168
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:26,780
<font face="Georgia" size="43">In 2015 she won the Grand Prix with Rie-Chan</font>

169
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:28,410
<font face="Georgia" size="43">What i like about this girl is</font>

170
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:32,410
<font face="Georgia" size="43">She reminds me of Miyuki Torii</font>

171
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,820
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Let's watch a clip of hers</font>

172
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:41,330
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Welcome, I'm Shizu Mizuno</font>

173
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:46,970
<font face="Georgia" size="43">This time, I will show you the Ultra Mizuno Quiz</font>

174
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:48,670
<font face="Georgia" size="43">On the back of the card, I made a mistake</font>

175
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,200
<font face="Georgia" size="43">I forgot to draw a hat</font>

176
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:54,570
<font face="Georgia" size="43">I wasn't able to correct my mistake...</font>

177
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:04,640
<font face="Georgia" size="43">So, first question: What is Shizu Mizuno's favorite sword in Dragon Quest?</font>

178
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:10,260
<font face="Georgia" size="43">It's the lightning sword</font>

179
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:13,030
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Did you like it?</font>

180
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:15,190
<font face="Georgia" size="43">She's completely on drugs</font>

181
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:17,190
<font face="Georgia" size="43"> </font>

182
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:19,660
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Yeah, she's suspicious </font>

183
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:22,030
<font face="Georgia" size="43">She's not in her right mind</font>

184
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:24,940
<font face="Georgia" size="43">She was like this when I met her one time.</font>

185
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,810
<font face="Georgia" size="43">We talked at this audition.</font>

186
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:29,010
<font face="Georgia" size="43">And she's always like that? - Yeah!</font>

187
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:31,540
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Was there someone who sticked out to you?</font>

188
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:35,650
<font face="Georgia" size="43">That was a lot of information to process, so I don't know yet..</font>

189
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:38,650
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Can't you just summarize them all in one book?</font>

190
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:44,520
<font face="Georgia" size="43">My goal is to become a goddess of Village/Vanguard [A gimmicky book store chain in Japan]</font>

191
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:48,260
<font face="Georgia" size="43">I want to publish a unique book</font>

192
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:50,400
<font face="Georgia" size="43">You like subcultures and so on?</font>

193
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:52,530
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Yes, I really like subcultures. That's why...</font>

194
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:54,860
<font face="Georgia" size="43">I was born in Kōenji [area of Tokyo famous for subcultures]</font>

195
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:57,830
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Isn't this freakin' exciting?</font>

196
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:00,140
<font face="Georgia" size="43">At Village/Vanguard I want to become a famous person.</font>

197
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,540
<font face="Georgia" size="43">That's her goal</font>

198
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:04,610
<font face="Georgia" size="43">So there is no reason for you to be here?</font>

199
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,040
<font face="Georgia" size="43">I'm wandering off in that direction lately..</font>

200
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:15,990
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Yuki Himura</font>

201
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:15,990
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Osamu Shitara</font>

202
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:17,990
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Bananaman</font>

203
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:21,060
<font face="Georgia" size="43">These are our members for tonight</font>

204
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:26,470
<font face="Georgia" size="43">What were you doing just now?</font>

205
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:28,870
<font face="Georgia" size="43">I couldn't come up with anything,</font>

206
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,800
<font face="Georgia" size="43">But there is something called a Kawago Chop</font>

207
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,440
<font face="Georgia" size="43">That was what I was doing </font>

208
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:39,740
<font face="Georgia" size="43">So, the member we're focusing on tonight is Kawago Chop!</font>

209
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:42,480
<font face="Georgia" size="43">You like thing's like that, right?</font>

210
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,420
<font face="Georgia" size="43">I love it!</font>

211
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:48,620
<font face="Georgia" size="43">You just presented to us a lot of idols, but we still have some idols left you didn't get to present in the video clip.</font>

212
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:53,390
<font face="Georgia" size="43">The people who appear in the Miss iD contest are awesome but</font>

213
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:55,830
<font face="Georgia" size="43">the judges are also really interesting</font>

214
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:57,960
<font face="Georgia" size="43">I really like them</font>

215
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:00,370
<font face="Georgia" size="43">The first person I want to recommend to you is..</font>

216
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:02,370
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Oomori Seiko. Do you know her?</font>

217
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:03,100
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Oomori Seiko</font>

218
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:07,410
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Singer-songwriter</font>

219
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:09,410
<font face="Georgia" size="43">She does a lot of really interesting things</font>

220
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:13,110
<font face="Georgia" size="43">At her concerts, she will jump into the audience</font>

221
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,680
<font face="Georgia" size="43">and kiss them</font>

222
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:17,180
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Her fans?</font>

223
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:22,890
<font face="Georgia" size="43">She also eats while singing</font>

224
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:24,890
<font face="Georgia" size="43">and then throw the food at her audience.</font>

225
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:27,590
<font face="Georgia" size="43">That's right, she has an unusual way of doing things.</font>

226
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:31,330
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Recently, through work I got to meet her</font>

227
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,700
<font face="Georgia" size="43">I got the chance to watch her live concert</font>

228
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:36,100
<font face="Georgia" size="43">This person is really something</font>

229
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:40,100
<font face="Georgia" size="43">I really understand why Hina-Chan likes her so much</font>

230
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:43,410
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Kissing? With her fans?</font>

231
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:45,440
<font face="Georgia" size="43">You can do that too, it's totally fine!</font>

232
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,680
<font face="Georgia" size="43">If you like it that much....</font>

233
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,310
<font face="Georgia" size="43">But.. That's unlike Nogizaka46..</font>

234
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:51,120
<font face="Georgia" size="43">If you like it your manager will be fine with it!</font>

235
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,120
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Hm... right..</font>

236
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:57,350
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Kissing is not okay, but eating rice while singing is fine!</font>

237
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:00,220
<font face="Georgia" size="43">That's crazy</font>

238
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:08,100
<font face="Georgia" size="43">She will bring a rice cooker and share the rice</font>

239
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:10,430
<font face="Georgia" size="43">That's something. I have never seen that before!</font>

240
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:13,140
<font face="Georgia" size="43">And you like stuff like that?</font>

241
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,640
<font face="Georgia" size="43">That's what I like</font>

242
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:19,540
<font face="Georgia" size="43">There's also an illustrator called Mel Kishida</font>

243
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,080
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Oh, you all know him?</font>

244
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,750
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Wow, awesome!</font>

245
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:29,520
<font face="Georgia" size="43">This person also was a judge on Miss iD?</font>

246
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,320
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Yes, he was but..</font>

247
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:33,890
<font face="Georgia" size="43">In reality he's a really perverted man.</font>

248
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:35,830
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Illustrator  Mel Kishida</font>

249
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:37,830
<font face="Georgia" size="43">That's him!?</font>

250
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:43,700
<font face="Georgia" size="43">He's a man but he likes to touch</font>

251
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,600
<font face="Georgia" size="43">He does hugging events</font>

252
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,910
<font face="Georgia" size="43">There are events where fans can touch his body</font>

253
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,010
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Why doesn't Nogizaka46 do it then too?</font>

254
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:54,010
<font face="Georgia" size="43">If you like it that much..</font>

255
00:13:55,080 --> 00:14:01,080
<font face="Georgia" size="43">This show was brought to you by these sponsors</font>

256
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:15,670
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Nogizaka46 under Inspection!!!</font>

257
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:23,680
<font face="Georgia" size="43">We will present information that have been passed on by fans, members and staff on things about Kawago we didn't know yet</font>

258
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:27,680
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Now some information from the informant Inoue</font>

259
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,380
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Unbalanced diet! </font>

260
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:33,450
<font face="Georgia" size="43">She doesn't eat most food</font>

261
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:38,390
<font face="Georgia" size="43">She doesn't eat seafood!</font>

262
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:41,760
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Sea food flavour is also not good</font>

263
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:45,660
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Food from Nagazaki like Castella [Japanese sponge cake] and Chanpon is also not eatable for her</font>

264
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:51,340
<font face="Georgia" size="43">On the other side, things she can eat are Natto and rice</font>

265
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,040
<font face="Georgia" size="43">But fish from Nagazaki is really tasty!</font>

266
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:55,270
<font face="Georgia" size="43">That maybe.. but..</font>

267
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:57,910
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Is it gross to you? The smell for example?</font>

268
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:58,580
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Yes, it's gross.</font>

269
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:01,010
<font face="Georgia" size="43">But when I think 'Let's eat it'</font>

270
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,480
<font face="Georgia" size="43">I can eat it without making an awful expression</font>

271
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:06,480
<font face="Georgia" size="43">But I don't want to just pointlessly eat things</font>

272
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:10,520
<font face="Georgia" size="43">I want to spend my life eating tasty things</font>

273
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:12,990
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Everybody thinks like that, right?</font>

274
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:16,060
<font face="Georgia" size="43">That's what I only want to eat absolutely tasty things</font>

275
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:18,730
<font face="Georgia" size="43">So you only want to eat things that you yourself think are tasty</font>

276
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,070
<font face="Georgia" size="43">I try not to eat food from the sea</font>

277
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:25,170
<font face="Georgia" size="43">You don't eat crabs?</font>

278
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,040
<font face="Georgia" size="43">I don't</font>

279
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,270
<font face="Georgia" size="43">What do you think about Dashi? [Japanese soup stock made from fish]</font>

280
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:29,870
<font face="Georgia" size="43">So when something reminds you of fish..</font>

281
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:32,780
<font face="Georgia" size="43">I also don't like things from the shore</font>

282
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:36,950
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Are there still other things you don't like?</font>

283
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:38,920
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Red meat</font>

284
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,220
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Meat that has a redness to it</font>

285
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,420
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Things like roast beef..</font>

286
00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:44,060
<font face="Georgia" size="43">That's right!</font>

287
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:45,120
<font face="Georgia" size="43">How about swine?</font>

288
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:46,120
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Swine is fine</font>

289
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:47,930
<font face="Georgia" size="43">You have a chance!</font>

290
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:49,930
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Swine is fine</font>

291
00:15:56,070 --> 00:15:58,070
<font face="Georgia" size="43">She cannot eat cream puffs as well</font>

292
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,100
<font face="Georgia" size="43">I thought that she'd like that</font>

293
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:03,510
<font face="Georgia" size="43">How about custard?</font>

294
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:07,980
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Things that are soft from the outside, but are not nourishing, I also cannot eat</font>

295
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:10,950
<font face="Georgia" size="43">So what can things can you really eat then?</font>

296
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:14,050
<font face="Georgia" size="43">I also cannot eat things that stick in my teeth</font>

297
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:16,050
<font face="Georgia" size="43">But that's every food!</font>

298
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,390
<font face="Georgia" size="43">I also don't eat snacks or candy</font>

299
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:22,190
<font face="Georgia" size="43">What about potato chips?</font>

300
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:22,700
<font face="Georgia" size="43">I can't eat that also..</font>

301
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:25,060
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Have you never eaten Kyabetsu Taro? [Japanese snack food]</font>

302
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,500
<font face="Georgia" size="43">I have never eaten it!</font>

303
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
<font face="Georgia" size="43">And Umai Bou?</font>

304
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:31,700
<font face="Georgia" size="43">So you can't answer the question what flavour you like?!</font>

305
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:32,700
<font face="Georgia" size="43">I cannot</font>

306
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:34,410
<font face="Georgia" size="43">What flavour do you like?</font>

307
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:35,110
<font face="Georgia" size="43">One.. Two..</font>

308
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:36,570
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Salami</font>

309
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:38,570
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Close friends</font>

310
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:46,720
<font face="Georgia" size="43">While we're at it, let's hear what kind of food the other members don't like to eat</font>

311
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:51,720
<font face="Georgia" size="43">First, what things doesn't Takayama like to eat?</font>

312
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,430
<font face="Georgia" size="43">You will eat anything, right?</font>

313
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:58,060
<font face="Georgia" size="43">I don't like to drink water</font>

314
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,360
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Wait, you have to be kidding me?!</font>

315
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:03,370
<font face="Georgia" size="43">She doesn't like to drink water!?</font>

316
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:05,500
<font face="Georgia" size="43">My teeth would hurt..</font>

317
00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:07,240
<font face="Georgia" size="43">From drinking water!?</font>

318
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:12,340
<font face="Georgia" size="43">I also don't like to eat Japanese style curry</font>

319
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:17,080
<font face="Georgia" size="43">But I really like Thai style curry</font>

320
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,290
<font face="Georgia" size="43">But I don't really like Japanese style curry</font>

321
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:21,220
<font face="Georgia" size="43">What exactly is Japanese style curry?</font>

322
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:23,220
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Tell us about that first</font>

323
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:25,220
<font face="Georgia" size="43">For Himura, every curry served in Japan is Japanese style curry</font>

324
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:29,260
<font face="Georgia" size="43">There is Thai curry and Indian curry...</font>

325
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:32,430
<font face="Georgia" size="43">I can eat curry while putting in on Nan bread but Japanese curry..</font>

326
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,470
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Why don't you eat it?</font>

327
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:38,740
<font face="Georgia" size="43">When it has cooled down, doesn't it feel really rough in your mouth?</font>

328
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,640
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Uh, I get it!</font>

329
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,910
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Somehow, you don't like American food as well?</font>

330
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:49,450
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Ah, that's right, I don't like to eat it.</font>

331
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:52,180
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Because I don't like fries</font>

332
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:58,060
<font face="Georgia" size="43">I have never ordered it, since I was born</font>

333
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:00,130
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Why don't you like fries?</font>

334
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:02,130
<font face="Georgia" size="43">I don't really like things that are fried..</font>

335
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:05,160
<font face="Georgia" size="43">What about potatoes that have not been fried?</font>

336
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,600
<font face="Georgia" size="43">I love potatoes</font>

337
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,200
<font face="Georgia" size="43">My mother is a pretty good cook</font>

338
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:14,140
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Even back in the past I didn't like fried food</font>

339
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,910
<font face="Georgia" size="43">But my father really loves them</font>

340
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,440
<font face="Georgia" size="43">That's why everyday on his way home, he would buy dishes from the super market</font>

341
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:22,810
<font face="Georgia" size="43">How about Karaage? [Japanese style fried chicken]</font>

342
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:26,890
<font face="Georgia" size="43">In Boso we have a shop called 'Chicken Basket'</font>

343
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:29,250
<font face="Georgia" size="43">I can eat the Karaage from there but not from anywhere else</font>

344
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,220
<font face="Georgia" size="43">But it's the same everywhere</font>

345
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,290
<font face="Georgia" size="43">But Chicken Basket is freakin' tasty!</font>

346
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:36,290
<font face="Georgia" size="43">That Chicken Basket!</font>

347
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,870
<font face="Georgia" size="43">They have this thing called Nakapan, that's really delicious</font>

348
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,640
<font face="Georgia" size="43">You could also eat other fried stuff apart from that Nakapan</font>

349
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,140
<font face="Georgia" size="43">NO NO NO NO NO ∩(︶▽︶)∩</font>

350
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:48,870
<font face="Georgia" size="43">How about KFC?</font>

351
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:51,140
<font face="Georgia" size="43">I have never eaten there</font>

352
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,950
<font face="Georgia" size="43">But Hoshino is also similarly picky like me</font>

353
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,280
<font face="Georgia" size="43">For example I also don't like to drink water</font>

354
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:58,650
<font face="Georgia" size="43">I also don't like curry </font>

355
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:01,450
<font face="Georgia" size="43">But I overcame my dislike of water and curry</font>

356
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:04,550
<font face="Georgia" size="43">So, what doesn't Hoshino like to eat?</font>

357
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:08,090
<font face="Georgia" size="43">I don't like carbonated water and popcorn</font>

358
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:15,230
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Eh, but it's so tasty!</font>

359
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:18,970
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Originally, I didn't like to drink juice </font>

360
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,400
<font face="Georgia" size="43">So I only drank tea</font>

361
00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:24,310
<font face="Georgia" size="43">The first time I drank a carbonated drink</font>

362
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,880
<font face="Georgia" size="43">I didn't like that it tingled my throat</font>

363
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:31,620
<font face="Georgia" size="43">I have tried some carbonated drinks but..</font>

364
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:35,350
<font face="Georgia" size="43">The only drink I haven't drank yet is Cola</font>

365
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:39,290
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Not even once since you were born!?</font>

366
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:44,900
<font face="Georgia" size="43">After this, Hoshino will drink cola for the first time in her life</font>

367
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:49,200
<font face="Georgia" size="43">That's the first cola in her life</font>

368
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,540
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Let's go!</font>

369
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:54,570
<font face="Georgia" size="43">This is awful. I don't know what to do</font>

370
00:19:55,910 --> 00:20:05,080
<font face="Georgia" size="43">But this is just Cola!</font>

371
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,080
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Tasty</font>

372
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:09,990
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Did you just that it's tasty?</font>

373
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,320
<font face="Georgia" size="43">No, I can't drink this!</font>

374
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:16,460
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Try some again but drink it slowly</font>

375
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,200
<font face="Georgia" size="43">I don't like it</font>

376
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,470
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Have some</font>

377
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:29,110
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Is it alright?</font>

378
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:31,510
<font face="Georgia" size="43">You can drink the Cola</font>

379
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:38,320
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Ahh.. 」(￣▽￣」)</font>

380
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:40,750
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Sorry about that, please edit that out</font>

381
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:41,690
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Tasty, man!</font>

382
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:43,590
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Hoshino, it should be like that!</font>

383
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:46,460
<font face="Georgia" size="43">But it feels weird in the throat</font>

384
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:50,790
<font face="Georgia" size="43">But how do you drink your whiskey then?</font>

385
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:52,330
<font face="Georgia" size="43"></font>

386
00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:54,300
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Why would you think she likes to drink Highball?</font>

387
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:56,300
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Soda assumption of a drunkard</font>

388
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:00,640
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Let's hear what Fukagawa doesn't like to eat</font>

389
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:04,210
<font face="Georgia" size="43">I don't like to eat it celery </font>

390
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:06,210
<font face="Georgia" size="43">I have a trauma</font>

391
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:08,340
<font face="Georgia" size="43">When I was little, I watched a foreign TV show for children</font>

392
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:10,750
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Celery was dipped into peanut butter...</font>

393
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:12,750
<font face="Georgia" size="43">I know what you're talking about!</font>

394
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:15,150
<font face="Georgia" size="43">They were eating it and it looked delicious</font>

395
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:19,950
<font face="Georgia" size="43">So I asked my mother to make some celery with peanut butter for me</font>

396
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:23,330
<font face="Georgia" size="43">So I ate my first celery then but.</font>

397
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:25,830
<font face="Georgia" size="43">But I was shocked by how different it tasted from what I was expecting</font>

398
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:28,600
<font face="Georgia" size="43">That's why I don't eat it </font>

399
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
<font face="Georgia" size="43">So, you also cannot eat peanut butter?</font>

400
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,400
<font face="Georgia" size="43">I like peanut butter but</font>

401
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:36,140
<font face="Georgia" size="43">You only hated the celery?</font>

402
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:37,580
<font face="Georgia" size="43">I only hate the celery</font>

403
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:43,080
<font face="Georgia" size="43">So let's give the members who hate celery or haven't eaten it yet a taste!</font>

404
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:46,420
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Actually, we will not force you to do it but</font>

405
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:50,120
<font face="Georgia" size="43">why don't we try some of the celery with peanut butter?</font>

406
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:52,690
<font face="Georgia" size="43">I want them to eat it</font>

407
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:57,460
<font face="Georgia" size="43">First up is Shinuchi, who hates celery on its own</font>

408
00:21:58,030 --> 00:22:00,030
<font face="Georgia" size="43">From the smell of the celery alone, I can't really do this..</font>

409
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:01,130
<font face="Georgia" size="43">The smell is horrible to you too?</font>

410
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:14,280
<font face="Georgia" size="43">How is it?</font>

411
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:16,150
<font face="Georgia" size="43">Huh!?</font>

412
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:21,350
