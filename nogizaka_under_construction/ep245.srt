there's a Nogizaka46 category that is limited to just 10 points

Some of you here likely know how strong we are at naming Nogizaka songs

69
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:01,380
Its just that in our case

Which girls are strong at name that tune?

77
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:20,250
Kubo is powerful at naming Nogizaka songs right?

78
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:22,310
That's right...doesn't feel like I can lose

79
