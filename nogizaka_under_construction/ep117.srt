00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:12,160
Taking part in the prayer for the 18th single to be a hit

2
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,830
are double centers Ozono and Yoda

3
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:19,330
And their challenge in wishing for a hit

4
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:22,900
Go underwater, get up close to a sea turtle

5
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:24,460
and wish for that hit

6
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:25,640
was the plan

7
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:27,650
So then the both of them

8
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:29,250
in order to make this a success

9
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:31,740
had to get their diving license

10
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:34,160
In 2 days

11
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:36,400
working frantically at cramming for the test

12
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:40,000
arigatou gozaimashita

13
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:42,790
they were able to get their C-card without issue

14
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:45,290
There's just one part I don't understand

15
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,370
And part of that

16
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:47,380
Ikuta who's been wanting to dive for awhile gave her complaint
And part of that

17
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:50,280
Ikuta who's been wanting to dive for awhile gave her complaint

18
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:52,920
For these 2 to encounter a sea turtle

19
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:55,110
its off to the south, to Izu Oshima

20
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:59,180
Due to a typhoon, it was bad diving conditions

21
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:02,290
but they still fully enjoyed the dive

22
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:07,290
And now they're at the point where the turtles are often seen

23
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:12,540
Ozono: Think we'll see some turtles here?

24
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:14,190
Ozono: Over there?

25
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:16,900
They keep missing

26
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:19,390
and to find those hidden turtles

27
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:21,310
the both of them continue to swim around looking

28
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:22,890
However

29
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:25,590
Ozono: They're not here

30
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:27,230
Ozono: There's nothing here

31
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,290
On this day underwater

32
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:32,460
because of the typhoon that came in days earlier

33
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:35,420
the underwater visibility is at its worst

34
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:37,040
causing this unthinkable situation

35
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,570
Yoda: They're not here!

36
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:43,050
Their field of vision is completely affected

37
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:45,590
and they can't see anything clearly underwater

38
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,980
[ No sight of sea turtles anywhere ]

39
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:52,810
Ozono: Why aren't they here?

40
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:55,430
Yoda: What do we do?

41
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:59,360
They had to consider what was left in their tanks

42
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:01,120
and on Yoshida-san's judgment

43
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,880
they had to go back

44
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:08,260
On the 1st dive

45
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,530
they were unable

46
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:12,200
to find the sea turtles

47
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,300
Not that easy then

48
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:13,310
Staff: Tired?
Not that easy then

49
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:14,060
Staff: Tired?

50
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:16,290
I am tired.  How long were we diving?

51
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:17,610
That was about 40 minutes

52
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:18,720
eh!

53
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:21,450
For that next dive I'm going to

54
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:23,920
find about 500 turtles

55
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:27,260
Both still

56
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:29,640
have the energy and will

57
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:30,890
So here

58
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:32,890
instructor Yoshida-san

59
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:34,320
had this suggestion

60
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:36,010
Yoshida-san, onegai

61
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:37,860
Well, the sea turtles

62
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:40,350
there's an area where there's a high probability

63
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:42,480
of finding them but

64
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,200
its kind of difficult

65
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:45,870
to dive in that area

66
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,130
And that place

67
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,750
is called a "be on caution" diving point

68
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:51,830
The currents are exceptionally fast

69
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:52,580
and essentially

70
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:54,480
its for mid-level scuba divers

71
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,550
That's dangerous

72
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:58,880
They just got their licenses a couple days earlier

73
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,740
so what will their reponse be?

74
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:02,610
Want to try going there?

75
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:03,950
Let's do it.  Let's go

76
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:05,760
Let's try going over there then

77
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,420
hai

78
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,720
They want to find a sea turtle no matter what it takes

79
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:13,270
and full of detemination, its off to the 2nd dive

80
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,360
Yoda: The current is really pushing me!

81
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,080
As expected

82
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,360
this area is for mid-level and up experienced divers

83
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:25,480
if you're not paying attention, you'll quickly be carried away

84
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:28,390
and then

85
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:34,000
[ The 2 of them appear hand in hand ]

86
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:35,230
Holding hands

87
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:37,670
the both of them are doing what they can to fight the currents

88
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:39,750
Doing this alone would be impossible

89
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:42,220
but together they're ok

90
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:43,960
This is a good scene

91
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:43,970
Fitting of the meaning double center
This is a good scene

92
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:47,050
Fitting of the meaning double center

93
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:48,540
they look for turtles

94
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:52,200
Ozono: Any sea turtles here?

95
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,200
Yoda: No turtles

96
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:00,390
Its cruel to say, but all they did was consume time

97
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:02,720
Ozono: They're not here!

98
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:04,390
Ozono: They aren't here!

99
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,280
At that moment

100
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,920
one of the guide divers

101
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:10,680
makes a move in a certain direction

102
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,030
Found one?

103
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:14,390
Based on the sudden move

104
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:16,260
the 2 of them desperately give chase

105
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:17,660
Ozono: Found one?

106
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:22,910
And what appeared in front of them

107
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,140
Is that it?

108
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:32,090
[ sea turtle ]

109
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:32,740
Remarkably

110
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:35,670
its the sight of a turtle from behind

111
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,330
They got one!

112
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:41,730
Just like that this sea turtle appeared

113
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:43,900
and the sight of one

114
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:46,200
is a symbol of good fortune

115
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,640
Make a wish to it like that

116
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:48,940
Go!

117
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:50,760
The 2 of them tried to give chase

118
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:51,530
however

119
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:55,530
due to the high speed swimming of the turtle, they can't catch up

120
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:56,450
ganbare!

121
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:58,450
Yoda: Its mega fast

122
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:01,330
They both desperately give chase

123
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,130
however

124
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:08,230
What? They didn't see it?

125
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:10,000
This sea turtle they chased after

126
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:13,190
disappeared from sight

127
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:15,330
Its fast

128
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:17,260
Ozono: Did you see the turtle?

129
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:18,940
Yoda: It got away...

130
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:20,370
Yoda: I didn't see it

131
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:21,780
They were so close

132
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:21,790
In the end the both of them
They were so close

133
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:22,900
In the end the both of them

134
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:26,010
were unable to confirm the sighting of that sea turtle

135
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:27,200
They never saw it

136
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:29,910
And after that they eagerly searched around

137
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:31,930
for the appearance of another turtle

138
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:35,590
Ozono: No turtles here. Where are they?

139
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:37,100
Both of them are flustered

140
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:38,700
however

141
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:41,640
the more panicked you are, the more you waste movement

142
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:45,010
and you'll end up taking more oxygen...a vicious circle

143
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:48,130
Yoda: No turtles

144
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,630
Ozono: Why aren't they here?

145
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:53,530
At this point

146
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:55,730
both of them were low on oxygen

147
00:05:56,090 --> 00:06:00,000
and to continue the exploration was judged to be dangerous

148
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,650
In the end that sea turtle

149
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:01,660
never appeared a 2nd time
In the end that sea turtle

150
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:05,090
never appeared a 2nd time

151
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:07,210
Diving at the entry point I thought would have worked

152
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:08,860
They were so close

153
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:12,260
Even though they had no strength left to swim it made no difference

154
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:14,930
they still didn't want to give up

155
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,080
Was that the last dive?

156
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,780
But if we went one more time we might see one

157
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,760
However

158
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,430
We'd like to try again also but

159
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:28,650
even the pro divers are saying that's difficult

160
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:33,120
Its time for the last boat back

161
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:34,800
and more than anything else

162
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:37,800
they have to consider the physical condition of the members

163
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:40,030
Any hopes of going any further

164
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:40,040
were abandoned
Any hopes of going any further

165

were abandoned

166
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,740
It ends

167
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:45,450
with a near miss of seeing a sea turtle

168
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,210
We couldn't find one

169
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:52,890
even though we wanted to find one

170
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:56,330
Any decision on what's happening in a few days?

171
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:57,770
We don't know that

172
00:06:57,770 --> 00:06:58,760
don't know

173
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:01,890
Its just that under these conditions today, there can't be any more diving

174
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:03,780
Right now its no good

175
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:07,140
And there's no certainty there will be a next one

176
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,050
So we aren't making a wish? For a hit...

177
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:12,440
Nature is cruel

178
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,400
and for them seeing the sea turtles ends with a near miss

179
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:17,190
However at the same time

180
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:20,010
they fought bravely

181
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:22,210
for their prayer for a hit single

182
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:26,830
Now I get it

183
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:29,910
And with that, on camera

184
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,590
they were able to shoot a turtle, but the both of you

185
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:32,600
never saw one
they were able to shoot a turtle, but the both of you

186
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,080
never saw one

187
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:37,730
And then with the concern over your physical condition among other things

00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:12,520
Yoda: This is super fun

371
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:16,820
After only 5 minutes she's mastered the scooter

372
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:19,180
On the other hand

373
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:20,480
for Ozono

374
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:23,810
Ozono: It hurts. It hurts

375
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,120
During the dive

376
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,660
there appears to be something wrong

377
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:30,650
Are you hurt?

378
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:32,500
Ozono: My ear hurts. I can't clear it

379
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:34,830
Can't clear out your ear?

380
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,630
[ Ear hurts due to water pressure ]

381
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:39,160
As you dive the water pressure builds

382
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:41,180
and its causing Ozono's ear to hurt

383
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:44,090
If you pinch your nose

384
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:46,990
and keep your mouth closed

385
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,390
you can clear out the pressure from your ears but

386
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:52,600
her body isn't responding

387
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:54,740
and she's unable to release the pressure

388
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,270
and then

389
00:14:57,510 --> 00:14:59,350
Ozono: It hurts, it hurts, it hurts

390
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:00,170
Ozono: It hurts

391
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:00,180
Ozono: Somehow my head hurts
Ozono: It hurts

392
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:02,330
Ozono: Somehow my head hurts

393
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:04,570
And now she has

394
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,270
intense headaches

395
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:09,120
Staff: Take a seat for a moment

396
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:11,900
Its decided she can't go any further

397
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:13,700
and she's back on land

398
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:22,400
[ crying ]

399
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,870
Feeling disappointed with herself

400
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:25,360
the tears start to flow

401
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:29,070
On the other hand

402
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,280
unaware of Ozono's situation

403
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,030
Yoda heads for the open seas

404
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,510
The prayer was to happen together

405
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:39,770
before they knew it they had become separated

406
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:42,720
and then

407
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:45,920
Yoda: That was one!

408
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:51,680
The camera attached to the scooter is turned in the opposite direction

409
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,620
to show whats in front of her

410
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:56,370
Remarkably

411
00:15:56,570 --> 00:16:02,720
its the sight of a sea turtle

412
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,340
suddenly Yoda has camera footage of a sea turtle

413
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,170
Yoda: They're so fast

414
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:16,410
As she desperately tries to close the distance on it

415
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:23,860
in the end

416
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:26,730
once again a sea turtle disappears out of sight

417
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:33,870
and a 3rd chance to pray for a hit is lost

418
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:38,630
Both look down in silence and have taken on damage

419
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:40,720
in the end, what will they do?

420
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:47,160
Seeking revenge the 2 have failed on their 1st dive

421
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:49,110
and here

422
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,700
suffering from headaches

423
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:54,410
Ozono, who was forced to retire halfway, is asked about her health

424
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:57,850
Ozono, what's the plan?

425
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:00,600
I'm going

426
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,640
I'll go

427
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:04,650
Staff: Take a quick break

428
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:06,600
Staff: We'll see how you're doing after a rest

429
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,730
[ Take a quick rest and we'll check on you ]

430
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:11,380
In any case, its a quick rest

431
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:13,650
and see if she's up for a second round

432
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:16,240
[ One hour later ]

433
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:18,290
I'm diving

434
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:21,670
What'll I do if it starts hurting again?

435
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:26,160
Its not like she's become fully energized

436
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:28,770
and still appears concerned about not being able to dive

437
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:30,830
and then

438
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:32,540
under these conditions

439
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:36,010
they get a boost of encouragement from someone special

440
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:40,490
Sakurai - Sorry I can't be there with you but I'll be waiting

441
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,560
for both of you to return with a smile! We'll be working nonstop

442
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:45,410
after Osaka and it'll be tiring, so fight on without getting hurt!

443
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,150
And that was

444
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:48,500
something sent by Captain Sakurai

445
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,930
a couple of text messages

446
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,630
She's been really worried about you

447
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,640
she saw your diving video and it really moved her

448
00:17:55,850 --> 00:18:00,330
and she's been checking in to see if you're ok

449
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:01,980
They aren't alone

450
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:03,260
Sakurai

451
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:05,790
as captain is giving her support

452
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:11,250
After getting her message

453
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:13,240
its time for dive #4

454
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,330
this time

455
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:15,340
thinking of Ozono's physical condition
this time

456
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:17,280
thinking of Ozono's physical condition

457
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,480
they won't use the scooter and move slowly

458
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:28,590
Ozono: I'm ok

459
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,750
The deeper down they dive

460
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:35,120
the more burden it puts on your head and ears but

461
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:38,170
Yoda: Sure it doesn't hurt?

462
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:39,410
Ozono: Doesn't hurt

463
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:40,760
Yoda: That's great

464
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:44,140
Ozono: No pain at all

465
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:45,680
Ozono: Its happiness

466
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:49,480
Ozono's anxiety is completely gone

467
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:52,270
now they just have to find a sea turtle

468
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:57,040
A lot of turtles rest there

469
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:57,050
so they look closely within the ocean seaweed
A lot of turtles rest there

470
00:18:57,050 --> 00:19:00,260
so they look closely within the ocean seaweed

471
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:02,910
and then

472
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:04,430
at that moment

473
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,970
Ozono: That's a sea turtle

474
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:10,520
Ozono: WAH!

475
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,320
Ozono: WAH~ sugoi!

476
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:15,070
Its as if

477
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:17,790
the turtle had been waiting for them

478
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:19,970
as it calmy swims right in front of them

479
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:23,170
Yoda: Yes!

480
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:24,690
Yoda: Big one!

481
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:26,660
Yoda: sugoi!

482
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:29,280
Ozono: kawaii

483
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:34,560
Ozono: Its so pretty

484
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,430
Seeing the turtle at close range

485
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:41,950
has the both of them deeply excited

486
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:44,560
Yoda: We have to pray for a hit

487
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:51,440
Yoda: I wish for the 18th single to be a hit

488
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,500
Ozono: I wish for the 18th single to be a hit

489
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:56,200
And finally on the 4th dive

490
00:19:56,620 --> 00:20:03,230
the pray for a hit 18th single campaign has been accomplished

491
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:05,420
Ozono: We did it! I'm so happy

492
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:08,320
Ozono: Thank goodness

493
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:11,330
Starting from when they got their license

494
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:12,530
it took about 4 days

495
00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:14,620
and finally they've reached the conclusion

496
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:16,790
After that

497
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:19,020
all their past hardships were forgotten

498
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:20,840
as they found more sea turtles

499
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:23,480
Ozono: Ah! sugoi! There's another one!

500
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,310
Yoda: So happy

501
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:29,940
For a little while after

502
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:32,930
like a dream they spent more time with the turtles

503
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:36,280
And their final dive is complete

504
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:38,190
Ahh that was great

505
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,440
We prayed for a hit

506
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:42,330
That was great

507
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:44,760
And right here

508
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,370
for their 1st prayer for a hit

509
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:48,330
we'll look back as their new song plays

510
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:49,360
NIGEMIZU

511
00:20:49,510 --> 00:22:37,410
sea turtle version

512
00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:40,080
The prayer for the 18th single to be a hit

513
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,940
was a big success

514
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,220
Thank goodness
