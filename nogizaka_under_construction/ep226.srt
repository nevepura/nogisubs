there's suddenly a strong wind

38

39
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:01,210
a night time climb is waiting for them

ah I see it!

366
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:47,390
ah I can see it!

367
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,890
Just a little further!

368
00:18:54,860 --> 00:19:00,130
The peak is finally visible

369
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:02,250
Yakubo: This next part looks really steep...

370
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:03,750
Yakubo: Have to be careful going up

371
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,090
Wonder if it'll be ok

372
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:07,660
Hayakawa: A little worried....

373
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,920
At that moment

374
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:12,570
Manatsu-san!

375
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:15,260
There's just a little more left

376

Shibata: Did you hear that "ganbatte" just now?

377
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:22,470
The summit is right in front of them

378
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:25,930
eh is this? Still haven't passed through yet

379
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:30,310
And then at last

380
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:32,110
Guide: We're arriving at the true endpoint

381
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:33,830
Take your time

382
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:36,200
Keep fighting to the very end

383
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:39,340
Watch every single step

384
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:41,210

385
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,580

We're at the top!

389
00:19:56,470 --> 00:20:00,550
We made it!

390
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:01,580
Did it!

391
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,670
ehhh~ I'm so happy

392
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:12,300

we've made it to the top!

394
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,990
They've been updating Manatsu-san the whole way up

395
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:19,710
so happy

396
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:21,180
that took a lot of effort

397
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:26,140
Did the Yoshida Route team make it up?

398
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:29,270
They walk around the summit looking for the other members

399
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:30,810
And then...

400
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:34,030
See them?

401
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:35,630
OY!

402
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:36,860
Where are they?

403
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,860
Right in front of us

404
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:43,750
They'll be so happy to see them

405
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:44,620
ah over there

406
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,870

407
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:54,940
ehh

408
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:56,550
yes!

409

ah its the cat ears

410
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:10,790
oh they're all running

411
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:21,430
Hayakawa: We were able to meet you here!

412
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:36,410
You fought hard

413
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:38,710
Hayakawa: Where are the others?

414
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:41,070
Endo: They're right here

415
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:45,820
The 2 left on the Yoshida Route

416
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:49,820
took 2 hours and arrived at the summit safely

417
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:55,640
This time they were unable to have everyone meet at the top but

418
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:58,650
the 4th members combined their powers

419
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:02,040
and impressively were able to conquer 2 routes up Fuji

420
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,930
24th single

421
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:06,070

That's messed up...not sure what to say to that

427
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:47,070
That's real air from the summit then

454

That reminded me how brutal the climb up Fuji is

455
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,690
Akimoto in the middle of that you hurt your foot

456
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:14,160
That was so disappointing

457

I couldn't move my foot at that point

458

And then everyone carried my thoughts with them up to the top

459

When you were gone they sent a lot of messages with that Akimoto chant

460
