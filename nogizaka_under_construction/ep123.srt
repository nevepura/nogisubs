548
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:48,860
For perfect people, there's nothing worth doing for them

549
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:51,960
So a bad person that is someone worth saving

550
00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:54,200
I'll fall for them

551
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,690
She's too nice to whoever it is

552
00:21:57,690 --> 00:21:58,630
Ah, got it

553
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:01,220
No matter how many times he fails

554
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:04,110
she'll probably say "Can't do anything about that" and allow it

555
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:07,810
It really is a bunch of opinions like this

556
00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:07,820
Everyone appears to agree
It really is a bunch of opinions like this

557

Everyone appears to agree

558
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,560
Even if he makes the same mistake again

559
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:13,920
if he just apologizes, I'll be like "its ok"

560
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:18,500
Ito Karin, Higuchi, Akimoto

561
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,050
these ladies are awesome

562
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:22,310
[ Well received by men, top 3 ]

563
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:24,590
Good traits from a male point of view

564
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:28,620
Wakatsuki and Sakurai, they did the Memories of Matsuko play

565
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:31,030
aren't they just like the main character?

566
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:33,010
I saw it

567
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:35,580
I went to see it twice

568
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:37,600
I really sympathized with that character

569
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,620
Did it make you want to go up on stage?

570
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:41,700
[ Invades the play out of sympathy? ]

571
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:43,760
That's it!  That's it!

572
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:44,610
The real Matsuko

573
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,820
Ah, we're ok?

574
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:54,770
They're telling me that's enough for today

575
00:22:55,370 --> 00:22:57,420
Only had the bad themes today

577
00:22:57,420 --> 00:23:00,230
All insults, but they wanted to do this right

578
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:03,020
At the end we have a really good theme

579
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:03,590
What's last?

580
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:05,060
Last?

581
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,320
What's left?

582
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:08,760
Even stuck on an uninhabited island, seems like she'd survive elections

583
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,590
[ That's not a compliment either ]

584
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:13,210
I'm not sure if that's a compliment or insult

585
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:16,060
Just announce 1st for this one

586
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:17,890
Just 1st place?

587
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:22,530
Even if stranded on an uninhabited island she'd likely survive elections

588
00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:24,090
In 1st place

589
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:27,300

[ 1st place - Wakatsuki Yumi - Congratulations! ]

593

[ 1st place - Wakatsuki Yumi - Congratulations! ]

594
00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:42,200
Wakatsuki

595
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:44,240
It says Wakatsuki

596
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,910
omedetou gozaimasu

597
00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:45,920
And the reasons
omedetou gozaimasu

598
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,910
And the reasons

599
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:49,940
Seems like she could make something to escape

600
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:52,860
[ This woman never gives up ]

601
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:56,160
Seems like she'd make something

602
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:59,130
Just give her a bunch of chopsticks and she'll build something

603
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:01,720
[ Escapes just by using Hashi-kun ]

604
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:03,250
I've really

605
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:06,820
never seen her eat anything

606
00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:09,980
I see. She can survive if she doesn't eat then

607
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:11,890
She can go hungry for a long time

608
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:15,400
Even though she has the chopsticks she won't eat

609
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:17,350
[ The chopsticks are her partner ]
