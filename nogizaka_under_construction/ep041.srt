00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:20,070
<font size="40">There’s a lot of them.</font>

7
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:23,540
<font size="40">Now, with these people are gathered here,</font>

00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:26,380
<font size="40">Please announce what we have for today!</font>

<font size="40">Big announcement of the senbatsu members for the 14th single!</font>

10
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:35,880
<font size="40">We’re already at the 14th single.</font>

11
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:38,650
<font size="40">That’s really great.</font>

12
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:40,920
<font size="40">Furthermore, they made an appearance in the Kouhaku. 
-Right.</font>

13
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,460
<font size="40">So, from here is a brand new..</font>

14
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:46,120
<font size="40">-Right. 
The second chapter, isn’t it?</font>

18
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:58,470
<font size="40">Chosen last time are these 16 members.</font>

19
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:02,470
<font size="40">For the 14th single, what kind of members will it be composed of?</font>

20
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:06,850
<font size="40">We’ll start the announcement from the formation.</font>

21
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:08,010
<font size="40">Here it is.</font>

22
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:10,220
<font size="40">This is what it will look like.</font>

23
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:13,720
<font size="40">We have 17 senbatsu members.</font>

24
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:17,020
<font size="40">One more member than the last time.</font>

25
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:20,330
<font size="40">Very well, we’ll start the announcement right away.</font>

26
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:21,870
<font size="40">Oh, we’re doing it already?</font>

27
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:22,860
<font size="40">Well then,</font>

<font size="40">3rd row</font>

00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:28,730
<font size="40">The first name to be called is…</font>

31
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:31,870
<font size="40">Sakurai Reika</font>

32
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:34,200
<font size="40">Sakurai.</font>

33
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:40,250
<font size="40">Ever so supportive to Nogizaka as its Captain, Sakurai,</font>

34
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:42,580
<font size="40">Selected as a senbatsu this time as well.</font>

35
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:45,220
<font size="40">It’s been a while since we have this kind of ambiance right?</font>

36
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:46,690
<font size="40">Well, it’s kinda like that.</font>

37
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:48,750
<font size="40">Because I was first, I thought “Uwa.”</font>

38
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:52,670
<font size="40">Something like you’re not yet ready but “Ah, it started already, I got called.” That kind of feeling.</font>

39
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,430
<font size="40">But from here, it’s the 14th single. What are your feelings about this?</font>

40
00:01:57,430 --> 00:02:02,730
<font size="40">Of course, by having the privilege of performing in the Kouhaku,</font>

41
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:07,210
<font size="40">I think that the attention given to us will rise immediately.</font>

42
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:14,410
<font size="40">With awareness of that, I want to be active this year.</font>

43
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:17,780
<font size="40">I would like the Captain to lead everyone properly.</font>

44
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:24,650
<font size="40">It is the representation of Captain’s feelings.</font>

45
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:25,890
<font size="40">What are you laughing about?</font>

46
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:28,060
<font size="40">It means “I’ll do my best,” right?</font>

47
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:29,460
<font size="40">That’s true.</font>

48
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:31,530
<font size="40">What are they laughing about? 
-Right?</font>

49
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:32,100
<font size="40">Yes!</font>

50
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,460
<font size="40">Those kinds of feelings become visible, right?</font>

51
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:34,700
<font size="40">I’ll definitely lead them forward!</font>

52
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:37,040
<font size="40">That’s what it was, right? 
-You’re pumped up for this.</font>

53
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:39,390
<font size="40">Were senbatsu announcements always like this?</font>

54
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:40,640
<font size="40">[We have forgotten how it felt]</font>

55
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,440
<font size="40">Well then…

56
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:46,210
<font size="40">Now, let’s keep going. 
-Okay.</font>

57
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,010
<font size="40">Next…</font>

58
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:48,080
<font size="40">Third row,</font>

00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:56,050
<font size="40">Hori Miona</font>

62
00:02:56,150 --> 00:03:01,160
<font size="40">It’s Hori!</font>

63
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:05,860
<font size="40">Hori who has increased her skills in Under,
 returning to senbatsu after three singles.</font>

64
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:08,130
<font size="40">What are your current thoughts?</font>

65
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:14,150
<font size="40">It’s been a while since I’ve been selected in the senbatsu,</font>

66
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:17,980
<font size="40">I feel really happy for being selected in the senbatsu after a long time, but,</font>

67
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:21,250
<font size="40">There are also feelings of frustration.</font>

68
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:25,320
<font size="40">Little by little, while watching the senpais from behind,</font>

69
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:28,250
<font size="40">I’m thinking that “It would be nice if I could go in front.”</font>

70
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:33,150
<font size="40">Hori has gained various experiences too,</font>

71
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:35,490
<font size="40">and those experiences became her strength. Do your best.</font>

72
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:37,850
<font size="40">I’ll do my best. Thank you very much.</font>

73
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:39,000
<font size="40">hai, omedetou, gozaimasu~</font>

74
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:42,200
<font size="40">There are 15 left.</font>

75
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:43,470
<font size="40">Next…</font>

<font size="40">#12</font>

77
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:48,340
<font size="40">The next name to be called is…</font>

78
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:51,310
<font size="40">Wakatsuki Yumi</font>

79
00:03:56,050 --> 00:04:00,950
<font size="40">Her innate seriousness bloomed into a new character, Wakatsuki also made it in the senbatsu.</font>

80
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:07,360
<font size="40">Last time, I’m also assigned in the third row but I was given the privilege of doing a stage play.</font>

81
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:13,200
<font size="40">I was beginning to think that it wouldn’t matter even if I was in the third row position.</font>

82
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,930
<font size="40">But in handshake events,</font>

83
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:21,140
<font size="40">"Go into a spot where it’s easy for us to see you.” I think they’re saying that positively.</font>

84
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:26,010
<font size="40">I still couldn’t respond to that, I’m sorry but,</font>

85
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:29,980
<font size="40">I believe that this is the year to make things happen for Nogizaka.</font>

86
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:32,420
<font size="40">I’d like to do my best. Yoroshiku onegaishimasu~</font>

87
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:37,790
<font size="40">Wakatsuki has a lot of things going on too, like stage plays. 
-That’s right.</font>

88
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:40,730
<font size="40">You really are serious, huh? From one aspect to another.</font>

89
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,260
<font size="40">Did you bring it today?</font>

90
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:44,700
<font size="40">Today is… this is a bit of a proper occasion, so I have to stop.</font>

00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:45,420
<font size="40">[Self-restraint from Hashi-kun]</font>

92
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:47,230
<font size="40">What exactly is a proper occasion?</font>

93
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:51,200
<font size="40">I think that it's not suitable for the ambiance we have here.</font>

94
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,450
<font size="40">That right there is being serious too, right?</font>

95
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:54,570
<font size="40">[That’s being serious too]</font>

96

97
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:00,150
<font size="40">Then.. 
-Yes.</font>

98
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:01,770
<font size="40">Let’s proceed to the next one. 
-Okay.</font>

99
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:05,420
<font size="40">The next senbatsu member is…</font>

100
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:08,190
<font size="40">Inoue Sayuri</font>

101
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:15,490
<font size="40">Inoue with a remarkable growth in stage plays and the like,</font>

102
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:17,930
<font size="40">selected in the senbatsu for three consecutive times.</font>

103
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:24,300
<font size="40">Last year, Nogizaka was great as we’re getting bigger one by one.</font>

104
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:28,810
<font size="40">Because everyone was doing their best while carrying Nogizaka’s signboard on their back,</font>

105
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:35,010
<font size="40">I also wanted my favorite acting and stage play to become useful.</font>

106
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:43,560
<font size="40">I want to contribute so that we can appear in other works.</font>

107
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,350
<font size="40">That’s great</font>

108
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:46,890
<font size="40">It feels like you really have matured.</font>

109
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:49,280
<font size="40">Please do your best. 
I’ll do my best.</font>

110
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,870
<font size="40">The remaining spots… there are 13 spots.</font>

111
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:54,700
<font size="40">Thirteen. 
-Yes.</font>

112
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:55,530
<font size="40">Next,</font>

113
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:56,700

<font size="40">#13</font>

115

<font size="40">The next name to be called is…</font>

116
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,700
<font size="40">Matsumura Sayuri</font>

117
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:13,250
<font size="40">With her cheerful character that brightens the show, Matsumura,</font>

118
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:15,350
<font size="40">selected in the senbatsu this time as well.</font>

119
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,560
<font size="40">Hhmm, what do I have to say?</font>

120
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:22,480
<font size="40">It’s like… Because I have a lot of things that I want to do from now on,</font>

121
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:25,330
<font size="40">I have to strive for that as well.</font>

122
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,630
<font size="40">What’s the field of work that you want to strive for?</font>

123
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:29,790
<font size="40">I wanted to do plays.</font>

124
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:33,210
<font size="40">I’m not really good at it though.</font>

125
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:35,310
<font size="40">It’s alright, it doesn’t matter.</font>

126
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:39,580
<font size="40">But the things I want to do came out little by little from within myself.</font>

127
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:45,550
<font size="40">Therefore, everyone is doing their best in their personal jobs in order to return the favor to Nogizaka.</font>

128
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:51,760
<font size="40">Even everyone in Nogizaka thinks that it would be nice if the group gets bigger.</font>

129
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:53,960
<font size="40">Splendid. 
-Right?</font>

130
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:55,880
<font size="40">Please do your best.</font>

131
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:01,430
<font size="40">That makes it five.</font>

132
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:03,700
<font size="40">There are 12 remaining spots.</font>

133
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:06,970
<font size="40">The next senbatsu member is…</font>

134
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,210
<font size="40">Ito Marika</font>

135

137
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:30,650
<font size="40">Last year, I was also aiming at developing my field of expertise,</font>

138
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:34,230
<font size="40">and to turn that into Nogizaka’s strength.</font>

139
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:39,070
<font size="40">Recently, I’ve finally felt that, to be honest.</font>

140
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:42,610
<font size="40">I feel that everyone is developing at what they’re doing.</font>

141
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:48,780
<font size="40">Not just the front members, but I think everyone in the group are great.</font>

142
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:53,360
<font size="40">This year, at least by developing, I also want to make a contribution.</font>

143
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,450
<font size="40">That’s great.</font>

144
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:57,690
<font size="40">Please do your best. 
-Okay.</font>

145
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,860
<font size="40">Now, the last one for the 3rd row, right? 
-Yes.</font>

146
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:03,900
<font size="40">3rd row,</font>

147
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,630
<font size="40">The last one is…</font>

148
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:08,730
<font size="40">Ikoma Rina</font>

149
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:15,640
<font size="40">Active in variety as the face of Nogizaka, Ikoma,</font>

150
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,580
<font size="40">in the 3rd row this time as well.</font>

151
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:18,510
<font size="40">Thank you, thank you.</font>

152
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:21,410
<font size="40">You also became an adult, huh? 
-Yes, I’ve become an adult.</font>

153
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:23,680
<font size="40">14th single. 
-That’s right.</font>

154
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:30,660
<font size="40">From that time as Taiyou Knock’s center, it could be perceived that I’ve gone downhill.</font>

155
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:35,480
<font size="40">Personally, I really think that it was an easy place to work in.</font>

156
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:40,290
<font size="40">There are a lot of opportunities handed down right there.</font>

157
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:44,510
<font size="40">It’s not making me disappointed but,</font>

158
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:49,440
<font size="40">It's just that, I hope that more people will be more interested in me.</font>

159
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,110
<font size="40">Well, of course, ideally, getting on any spot is already good enough,</font>

160
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:58,180
<font size="40">But to get closer to that, you have to make an effort. 
Someone is watching, no doubt.</font>

161
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:01,360
<font size="40">Do your best. 
-I will.</font>

162
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,340
<font size="40">omedetou gozaimasu.</font>

163
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,880
<font size="40">From this point, it’s the Juu Fukujin.</font>

164
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,490
<font size="40">2nd row,</font>

165
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:09,490
<font size="40">#6</font>

166
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:13,830
<font size="40">First one in the Fukujin is?</font>

167
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,400
<font size="40">Saito Asuka</font>

168
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:24,940
<font size="40">Expected to carry the next generation, Saito Asuka,</font>

169
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:26,980
<font size="40">Fukujin for two consecutive times.</font>

170
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:34,320
<font size="40">Last time, that was the first time I’ve been selected for the Fukujin,</font>

171
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:41,630
<font size="40">From the beginning, the group has been supported by the front members,</font>

172
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:48,730
<font size="40">I’ve been thinking that I’m still nothing compared to other members and onee-sans.</font>

173
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,900
<font size="40">The Under members did a live concert at Bukodan,</font>

174
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:58,410
<font size="40">For the senbatsu members too, the opportunities of work in here are increasing rapidly.</font>

175
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:00,980
<font size="40">I was thinking, “Ah, I’m not doing anything.”</font>

176
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:05,880
<font size="40">But aren’t you’re doing something, with modeling and stuff?</font>

177
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:14,330
<font size="40">But maybe, this gloomy feeling of "I have not done enough" and lack of self-confidence is also a proof of growth.</font>

178
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:19,030
<font size="40">The things that you didn’t understand before, but now you do.</font>

179
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:20,300
<font size="40">Right?</font>

180
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:22,070
<font size="40">Aren’t you a model?</font>

181
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:27,210
<font size="40">Well, your comrades are here, and altogether…</font>

182
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:32,580
<font size="40">It’s not like you’re doing everything on your own, 
and I think everyone’s collective efforts are important.</font>

183
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:36,280
<font size="40">That’s a merit of the group, to do things that complement each other.</font>

184
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:39,890
<font size="40">You get along with one another, that’s what I think.</font>

185
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:41,090
<font size="40">I’ll do my best. 
-Alright.</font>

186
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:42,820
<font size="40">Please do your best.</font>

187
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:47,460
<font size="40">Now then, let’s move on.</font>

188
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:48,130
<font size="40">Next,</font>

189
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:49,230
<font size="40">2nd row,</font>

190
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:50,230
<font size="40">#10</font>

191
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:53,670
<font size="40">The next one to enter the 2nd row is…</font>

192
00:10:55,130 --> 00:11:01,340
<font size="40">Hoshino Minami</font>

193
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:04,460
<font size="40">With an innocent character, she constantly fascinates her surroundings, Hoshino,</font>

194
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:06,810
<font size="40">entered the Fukujin for two consecutive times.</font>

195
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:09,680
<font size="40">Everyone, just like what we’ve seen a while ago,</font>

196
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:13,490
<font size="40">have different jobs or more precisely, they have strong points.</font>

197
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:16,390
<font size="40">But I have… none, right?</font>

198
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:18,080
<font size="40">Really?</font>

199
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,890
<font size="40">You got an amazing personality I think. 
-No no no no no</font>

200
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:24,800
<font size="40">Recently, at a handshake event,</font>

201
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,930
<font size="40">I was told that “Why is Minami-chan included despite having no strong point? You’re really lucky, huh?”</font>

202
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:29,500
<font size="40">Eh?</font>

203
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,440
<font size="40">Someone told you something like that?</font>

204
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:37,180
<font size="40">From the beginning, I’ve done a lot of things.</font>

205
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:39,040
<font size="40">It’s so frustrating right?</font>

206
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:45,480
<font size="40">Well, of course, comparisons are natural,</font>

207
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:48,690
<font size="40">and it’s true that I don’t have a strong point.</font>

208
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:53,990
<font size="40">So I don’t know why I’m chosen.</font>

209
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:59,870
<font size="40">Then, having a visible strong point will also give me self-confidence,</font>

210
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:01,930
<font size="40">I want to have that.</font>

211
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:03,970
<font size="40">Really? Isn’t being cute enough?</font>

212
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:09,470
<font size="40">The fans also said the same thing, but I can’t stay like this.</font>

213
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:10,130
<font size="40">Is that so?</font>

214
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:11,480
<font size="40">I’m already 18 years old.</font>

215
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,750
<font size="40">You graduated from high school too… 
-I graduated from high school already.</font>

216
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:16,650
<font size="40">”Shouldn’t it be something that will make me a strange person?”</font>

217
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:19,350
<font size="40">”Shouldn’t it be whatever that stands out?” These kinds of feelings will linger within you.</font>

218
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:19,950
<font size="40">That’s right.</font>

219
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:22,020
<font size="40">I think so too.</font>

220
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:27,730
<font size="40">It’s offensive when someone says something like that directly on your face at handshake events.</font>

221
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:30,130
<font size="40">I’ve thought about that too,</font>

222
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,230
<font size="40">When I was told that, I thought that…</font>

223
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:35,100
<font size="40">The person who said that is a trash,</font>

224
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:38,240
<font size="40">That person’s life is somewhat worthless, that’s why.</font>

225
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,540
<font size="40">You’re definitely working harder than that guy.</font>

226
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:47,410
<font size="40">Then, you’re shaking his hands with a large smile on your face, 
but it's not okay.</font>

227
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:51,020
<font size="40">This is the 14th single and compared to the past, you’re quite successful already,</font>

228
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,880
<font size="40">But with the way you talk right here,</font>

229
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:58,390
<font size="40">Members with senbatsu experience who came here 
brought in new troubles they were facing.</font>

230
00:12:58,390 --> 00:12:59,790
<font size="40">There are those who even cried.</font>

231
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:02,060
<font size="40">-That was the case just now.</font>

232
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:04,500
<font size="40">But, it’s been 2 singles since the last studio announcement,</font>

233
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,400
<font size="40">It’s been a while. 
-since the last time I’ve had a conversation with Bananaman.</font>

234
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:08,700
<font size="40">You seem to have a father-figure.</font>

235
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:08,730
<font size="40">Father-figure?</font>

236
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:10,770
<font size="40">[Father?]</font>

237
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:15,180
<font size="40">Well, for me, that really warms me up inside,</font>

238
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:15,840
<font size="40">-That’s right.</font>

239
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:19,680
<font size="40">Ah, but, right now, I don’t want you to use that.</font>

240
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:23,020
<font size="40">We’re supposed to be your Onii-chan, but father?!</font>

241
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:24,450
<font size="40">[Official Father]</font>

242
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:26,080
<font size="40">Do your best. 
-I will.</font>

243
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:27,590
<font size="40">Thank you very much.</font>

244
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,590
<font size="40">Now, there are only 8 spots remaining.</font>

245
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:44,350
<font size="40">Next…</font>

246
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:45,350
<font size="40">2nd row,</font>

247
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:46,710
<font size="40">#7</font>

248
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:50,180
<font size="40">The next one to be called is…</font>

249
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:53,110
<font size="40">Takayama Kazumi</font>

250
00:13:57,050 --> 00:14:02,720
<font size="40">Takayama who fully displays her strong personality in the show, 
also made it in the Fukujin.</font>

251
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,660
<font size="40">Because 2015 has been really fun and fulfilling year,</font>

252
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:10,660
<font size="40">for 2016, I have dreams that I want to do.</font>

253
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:17,340
<font size="40">I’m also hoping that Nogizaka will become bigger.</font>

254
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:18,470
<font size="40">What kind of dream?</font>

255
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:26,110
<font size="40">Something like.. Nogizaka performing two or three songs in a music show.</font>

256
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:31,620
<font size="40">It has always been one song for us and it’s not enough to give everyone exposure.</font>

257
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,150
<font size="40">It would be great…</font>

258
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:34,390
<font size="40">Please stand still.</font>

259
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:35,820
<font size="40">[Please calm down]</font>

260
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,620
<font size="40">With several songs,</font>

261
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:42,730
<font size="40">Everyone will have a camera exposure, then everyone will be happy.</font>

262
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:49,130
<font size="40">For this idea to happen, combining our individual strengths is not a futile effort. I’ll do my best.</font>

263
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:51,500
<font size="40">Please do your best. 
I’ll do my best. Thank you very much.</font>

264
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:54,430
<font size="40">Then, let’s continue...</font>

265
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:55,740
<font size="40">Next,</font>

266
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:56,710
<font size="40">2nd row,</font>

267
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:57,590
<font size="40">#9</font>

268
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:01,550
<font size="40">The next one selected for the Fukujin is…</font>

269
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:03,980
<font size="40">Akimoto Manatsu</font>

270
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:10,990
<font size="40">Pushing forward on to the idol road she’s aiming for, Akimoto,</font>

271
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:12,990
<font size="40">entered the Juu Fukujin this time as well.</font>

272
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:21,600
<font size="40">As for my goal this year, I’d like to be a leading presence in the group even just a little.</font>

273
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:26,710
<font size="40">For the members who are doing their best in various places..</font>

274
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:30,940
<font size="40">at the time when they came back, Nogizaka is… how should I put this,</font>

275
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:36,210
<font size="40">I want to be right there to give stability to the group while they’re at their other jobs.</font>

276
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:40,490
<font size="40">That’s right, I think that your home base must be strong too.</font>

277
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:44,220
<font size="40">With assertiveness, right? You want this show to be able to withstand their absence, right?</font>

278
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:47,330
<font size="40">But if I have too much screen time, I think that will be a bit annoying.</font>

279
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:48,250
<font size="40">If we cut that part out, it’s all good.</font>

280
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:50,000
<font size="40">[We’ll do it here]</font>

281
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:50,760
<font size="40">Is that true?</font>

282
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,900
<font size="40">It’s alright, getting more exposure. This is Nogizaka’s own show after all.</font>

283
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:56,370
<font size="40">I’ll do my best. 
-Please do your best.</font>

284
00:15:56,370 --> 00:15:57,370
<font size="40">Thank you very much.</font>

285
00:15:58,770 --> 00:16:00,570
<font size="40">Now, the last one for the 2nd row.</font>

286
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:01,770
<font size="40">2nd row,</font>

00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:06,380
<font size="40">The last one in the 2nd row is?</font>

289
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:09,150
<font size="40">Eto Misa</font>

290
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:17,290
<font size="40">From Under to 1st row, dashing up on Nogizaka’s stairs, Eto,</font>

291
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:18,890
<font size="40">this time, she’s in the 2nd row.</font>

292
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:25,300
<font size="40">On the last single, I’m assigned in the 1st row,</font>

293
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:29,700
<font size="40">and when you look at it, my position fell.</font>

294
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:36,500
<font size="40">But with this, I’ve been chosen as Under and Senbatsu, then I’ll have experience from all rows.</font>

295
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:40,550
<font size="40">I have just realized it now. 
-Ah, really?</font>

296
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:45,180
<font size="40">I don’t know what my strong points are, but...</font>

297
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:50,860
<font size="40">...being in the end row of Under, then 2nd row, then 1st row,</font>

298
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:54,160
<font size="40">then on the Senbatsu too, having experience in all of those positions,</font>

299
00:16:54,460 --> 00:17:00,730
<font size="40">Even just a little, I think it would be nice if it worked as an asset for the team.</font>

300
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:06,140
<font size="40">After hearing that you’ve experienced every row,</font>

301
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:09,980
<font size="40">That is your sense of stability.</font>

302
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:12,180
<font size="40">No matter what position you’re in, you can get used to it.</font>

303
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,750
<font size="40">Please do your best. 
-I’ll do my best. Thank you as always.</font>

304
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:19,620
<font size="40">Now, the 2nd row is occupied.</font>

305
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:22,450
<font size="40">Finally, the 1st row. Five spots, right?</font>

306
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,190
<font size="40">All that’s left is the first row,</font>

307
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:27,260
<font size="40">Who will be called first?</font>

308
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:28,730
<font size="40">Ikuta Erika</font>

309
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:35,870
<font size="40">Her unwavering spirit continues to leave a strong impact, Ikuta,</font>

310
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:37,940
<font size="40">she's in the first row this time.</font>

311
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:41,570
<font size="40">After hearing everyone’s stories,</font>

312
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:44,910
<font size="40">Each one has a wonderful strong will,</font>

313
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:46,880
<font size="40">they also have various thoughts.</font>

314
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,080
<font size="40">Being in the first row,</font>

315
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:56,220
<font size="40">I want to spend these days without compromising anything.</font>

316
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:01,230
<font size="40">But in my case, I often… what was it?</font>

317
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:03,260
<font size="40">I ponder with it too much.</font>

318
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:10,040
<font size="40">The pressure is too much, it will make you feel really small.</font>

319
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,300
<font size="40">With a positive sense, I’ll set myself free,</font>

320
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:15,810
<font size="40">I'll stretch the antenna of my interest to various things,</font>

321
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:19,980
<font size="40">Then it would be nice if I could transmit various kinds of myself.</font>

322
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:23,280
<font size="40">Even if you’re feeling pressured, it seems that you’re able to push it aside though.</font>

323
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:28,620
<font size="40">Yes, but it’s really something I don’t have to face head on,</font>

324
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:30,260
<font size="40">because I won’t be able to accomplish anything.</font>

325
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:34,530
<font size="40">I made a barrier so that I can’t feel or encounter that pressure,</font>

326
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:38,200
<font size="40">because there are a lot of things I want to do. 
-Ah, is that so?</font>

327
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:45,940
<font size="40">For this single to, I hope that I could move freely in a positive sense.</font>

328
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:49,640
<font size="40">Do your best in leading others forward. 
-I’ll do my best.</font>

329
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,980
<font size="40">Now, there are only four left. 
-Four.</font>

330
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:56,080
<font size="40">Next,</font>

331
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,480
<font size="40">1st row,</font>

332
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,720
<font size="40">#1</font>

333
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:02,220
<font size="40">Next one to enter the first row is…</font>

334
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:05,120
<font size="40">Hashimoto Nanami</font>

335
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:12,330
<font size="40">Hashimoto has always supported the group as a Fukujin,</font>

336
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:14,430
<font size="40">she’s in the first row this time.</font>

337
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:18,100
<font size="40">My main concern is,</font>

338
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:22,740
<font size="40">I get sick more often than anyone in the group.</font>

339
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:28,080
<font size="40">Paying attention to your physical condition is something that must be done as a person.</font>

340
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:32,220
<font size="40">That’s something I want to do properly from now on,</font>

341
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:41,430
<font size="40">As one person is given more work, so are the responsibilities.</font>

342
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:45,760
<font size="40">As expected, I think that there are people around me who are concerned about that.</font>

343
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:51,270
<font size="40">So that I can respond to it in a good way, I’ll pay attention to my health.</font>

344
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:54,040
<font size="40">I hope that I can do my best.</font>

345
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:57,810
<font size="40">Physical condition, to some extent, there are parts where we can’t do anything about it.</font>

346
00:19:57,810 --> 00:20:03,550
<font size="40">But in busy situations, you have to get going to some extent, right?</font>

347
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:05,650
<font size="40">That’s right. 
-Please do your best.</font>

348
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:06,890
<font size="40">Thank you very much.</font>

349
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:12,560
<font size="40">The spots remaining are numbers 2, 3, and 4. Three spots.</font>

350
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:16,730
<font size="40">The next name to be called is…</font>

351
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,360
<font size="40">Shiraishi Mai</font>

352
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:25,670
<font size="40">Last time, she served as half of the double center, Shiraishi,</font>

353
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:28,370
<font size="40">this time, she’s in the 1st row position.</font>

354
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:31,880
<font size="40">In August, it will be 5 years since the group was formed.</font>

355
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:35,550
<font size="40">When you think of it, time goes by so fast..</font>

356
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:38,650
<font size="40">But I think there are still a lot to come for Nogizaka,</font>

357
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:40,790
<font size="40">for myself as well.</font>

358
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:43,820
<font size="40">We won't get satisfied just because we have already performed in the Kouhaku.</font>

359
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:48,430
<font size="40">There are still a lot of new roads to go to from here.</font>

360
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:53,130
<font size="40">I think that there still a lot of things that we have to open up.</font>

361
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:56,030
<font size="40">That goes for me as well.</font>

362
00:20:56,030 --> 00:21:00,740
<font size="40">With everyone as a group, I think we have to work hard this year.</font>

363
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:07,610
<font size="40">That’s right, from here on out, you have to put in new efforts, it feels like you’re starting again.</font>

364
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,880
<font size="40">Please do your best. 
-Thank you very much.</font>

365
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:15,230
<font size="40">Who will serve as center for the 14th single?</font>

366
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,090
<font size="40">All that’s left are two spots, huh? 
-Two.</font>

367
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:21,530
<font size="40">There are two remaining spots,</font>

368
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:23,900
<font size="40">Whose name will be called?</font>

369
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:26,030
<font size="40">Nishino Nanase</font>

370
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:34,710
<font size="40">Nishino also moved from being a  double center last time 
to a position that supports the new center.</font>

371
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:37,680
<font size="40">Here, for the nth time,</font>

372
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:43,680
<font size="40">I’ve been selected for the 1st row for a long time now but,</font>

373
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:49,620
<font size="40">Even now, I’m wondering why I’m in this spot.</font>

374
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:54,030
<font size="40">There are also a lot of worries but,</font>

375
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:58,630
<font size="40">Looking at myself like this,</font>

376
00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:06,870
<font size="40">”Do your best”, or “I admire you”, the people who say these kinds of things have increased.</font>

377
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:12,480
<font size="40">There are also hopes that these kinds of people continue to increase.</font>

378
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:19,920
<font size="40">Because of those people, gradually, ideals like “I want to become like this”</font>

379
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:25,320
<font size="40">These kinds of ideals are coming out from within me.</font>

380
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:29,390
<font size="40">Well, while thinking about why,</font>

381
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:34,450
<font size="40">Right now, these things that you want to get done,</font>

382
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:37,150
<font size="40">I wonder if you have accomplished them to some extent?</font>

383
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:39,290
<font size="40">We’ll look forward to it.</font>

384
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:42,270
<font size="40">I’d like to do my best. 
Okay, do your best.</font>

385
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:43,440
<font size="40">Thank you very much.</font>

386
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:49,250
<font size="40">Now, all that remains is the Center.</font>

387
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:53,690
<font size="40">Very well, the announcement for the Center.</font>

388
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:57,740
<font size="40">Who will be selected as the new center?</font>

389
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,130
<font size="40">Fukagawa Mai</font>

390
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,560
<font size="40">hai, omedetou gozaimasu~</font>

391
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:08,830
<font size="40">Fukagawa who has just announced her graduation,</font>

392
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:08,830
<font size="40">With her first center experience, can she decorate that <i>hanamichi</i>?</font>

393
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:12,100
<font size="40"><i>Hanamichi (lit. flower path) - passage to the stage where flowers are given</i></font>

394
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:15,740
<font size="40">Fukagawa, you have announced your graduation, right?</font>

395
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:21,380
<font size="40">This will serve as your last single.</font>

396
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:23,780
<font size="40">At the center position</font>

397
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,490
<font size="40">What are your thoughts right now?</font>

398
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:31,760
<font size="40">Honestly, that feeling of wanting to be happy also exist,</font>

399
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:37,830
<font size="40">But the feeling of being scared is strong.</font>

400
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:46,200
<font size="40">But after listening to everyone’s words,</font>

401
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,210
<font size="40">It’s our first single of the new year.</font>

402
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:51,040
<font size="40">No matter what the reason is, </font>

403
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:54,710
<font size="40">I was chosen as center so I can't let myself hold the group back from succeeding.</font>

404
00:23:56,150 --> 00:23:57,880
<font size="40">Well, about that…</font>

405
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:02,520
<font size="40">Up until now, you’ve been doing this with your comrades, and with everyone’s effort, that have solidified the group.</font>

406
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:05,140
<font size="40">A member who feel at ease, there’s none right?</font>

407
00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:07,490
<font size="40">You should stop thinking about holding everyone back,</font>

408
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:10,840
<font size="40">Instead, it would be better to think of running through to the end, right?</font>

409
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:14,330
<font size="40">We’re looking forward to it, on what will it be.</font>

410
00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:17,500
<font size="40">You’re the center, but please lead everyone for the last time.</font>

411
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:18,680
<font size="40">Please?</font>

412
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:24,610
<font size="40">omedetou gozaimasu 
-omedetou gozaimasu!</font>

413
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:29,610
<font size="40">Nogizaka46 go out to meet their new Center, Fukagawa Mai.</font>

414
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:32,450
<font size="40">A brand new starting point!</font>

415
00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:38,460
<font size="40">Getting in here is really that hard, right?</font>

416
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:40,830
<font size="40">But, I'll say this here over and over,</font>

417
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:42,630
<font size="40">Don't feel discouraged, do your best.</font>

418
00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:46,060
<font size="40">When your turn came up, so that you could deliver,</font>

419
00:24:46,060 --> 00:25:01,330
<font size="40">you have to prepare yourselves.</font>

420
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:03,330
<font size="40"></font>
