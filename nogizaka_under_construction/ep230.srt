00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:10,480
Here's what I'm doing given about 1 month of time

2
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,490
Everyone's goals tournament press conference!

3
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:16,880
I messed that up

4
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,480
Goals tournament?

5
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:20,890
Continuing on from last week

6
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:23,740
they all learned a new skill during the summer

7
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:27,450
and now they're holding a conference to present the results of everything they learned

8
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:32,880
However if they're unable to clear their challenge...they get a punishment game

9
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:35,210
So the next one

10
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:36,730
its Seimiya on the trampoline

11
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,880
We've got a camera out on location where she's at so

12
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:41,450
Trampoline training center?

13
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:45,950
huh? Its someone I've never seen before

14
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:48,040
[ Remember me? ]

15
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,610
Shinuchi...you went out there then?

16
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:51,100
I have Rei-chan next to me

17
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:52,920
I'm Seimiya Rei

18
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,010
domo domo

19
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:56,280
ah...everything is setup behind you then

20
00:00:56,490 --> 00:01:01,560
That's right...the trampolines are sitting right behind us

21
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:02,800
Nervous?

22
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,980
yes...really since practice

23
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:09,050
On a scale of 1 to 3 with 3 being normal where would you say you're at?

24
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:10,960
If 10 was perfectly normal?

25
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,970
3...he said 3 is normal

26
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,750
Out of 1 to 3

27
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:15,660
I'm a 3

28
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:18,410
[ Normal ]

29
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,880
Giving Seimiya guidance

30
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,670
part of Japan's Gymnastics Association as the General Manager of Judges in trampoline

31
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:25,600
Muto-san

32
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:31,240
First we'll check on the abilities of Seimiya who has previous gymnastics experience

33
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,330
You've done a fair amount of gymnastics haven't you?

34
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:37,120
Those aren't the moves of someone who tried it briefly

35
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:40,640
Seeing that sensei made a change to her goals

36
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:43,710
Rather than just the trampoline basics...if possible

37
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:48,540
I'd like to teach her some trampoline competition level skills

38
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:51,760
Sensei saw Seimiya's moves and decided

39
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:54,190
she wouldn't get the beginners course

40
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:56,190
Following trampoline competition rules

41
00:01:56,190 --> 00:02:00,040
he's asking her to level up her goals by doing 10 tricks consecutively

42
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:06,520
Shitara asked for it so here we'll ask sensei if she's ready to do flips

43
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:09,210
Staff: In 1 month

44
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:10,990
we were hoping to see somersaults

45
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:13,900
That is not something I recommend

46
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,740
Staff: How long does it take to learn?

47
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:18,830
For quick learners

48
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:20,250
it takes 3 months

49
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,060
There's a lot of risk involved

50
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,870
Of course the somersaults are at a high difficulty level

51
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:30,830
so to reach her goals

52
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:32,730
its 2 months of intense practice

53
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:37,480
Coming up...its the same as the trampoline competitions

54
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,400
she'll perform 10 tricks consecutively

55
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:43,640
Can she do it without making a mistake?

56
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:47,000
And then...will she show us some somersaults?

57
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:51,580
And with that she's going to attempt 10 tricks

58
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:56,090
since its a trampoline she'll just keep doing a new move on each jump

59
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:57,180
yes understood

60
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:58,890
Plus she only gets 1 shot

61
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:00,270
no mistakes

62
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:02,810
complete all the tricks and she passes

63
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:04,830
These are the rules however

64
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:05,870
you ok with that?

65
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:06,840
hai

uwah...this is making me nervous

73
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:37,550
She's starting...

74
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:39,900
oh! Started off with a back somersault....2

75
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:43,000
She quickly turned it around...#4

76
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:44,200

77
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:46,250
Was that 5?

78
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:49,480
whoa she did a flip

79
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,940
Did she do all of them?

80
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,410
She did it right?

81
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,480
She did it right?

82
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:00,300
Seimiya has been practicing for this day

83
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:03,690
Her first trick started off with a back somersault

84
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:05,530
then she went to the straddle jump

85
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:07,370
Then back to back she did

86
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:09,600
a seated landing and another with a half twist

87
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,470
then she regained her form and stood up

88
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:16,120
And then another seated landing with a half twist

89
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,620
she stood back upright and then a tuck jump

90
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:21,020
followed by a straddle jump

91
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,810
then she finished off the routine with a back somersault

92
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:27,000
some of the landings were a little off but

93
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,450
she completed all 10 of her tricks

94
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,460
Seimiya...those somersaults

95
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:34,990
he said it would be risky to learn those in that little time

96
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:36,560
but you just did 2 of them

97
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:39,520
I wanted to get those into the routine no matter what

98
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,800
so at the start and the end

99
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:44,160
I stuck them in

100
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:47,390
I'd like to ask sensei about that

101
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:51,370
sensei...she did that in a short amount of practice time...isn't that something

102
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:53,770
If she went into a competition

103
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:56,840
she could practically use that exact same routine

104
00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:00,430
For her to do all that was incredibly impressive

105
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,590
I'm thinking she's ready for competitions

106
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:06,650
She has natural talent

107
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:09,630
If you could tell us if she passed or failed...

108

we're not experts and can't make a proper judgement

109
