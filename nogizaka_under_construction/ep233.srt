25
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:21,660
Makeup is...

26
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:24,220
something a girl can't live without

27
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:29,460
Its your own personal pursuit to become the image of an ideal woman

28
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:33,020
It requires a kind of tuition...this is what best suits me

29

What's up with this picture?

39
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,540
you could say she's got her own unique style

40
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,660
Today too...she's got some unusual fashion

41
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:09,860
And now that she's 20

42

like femininity for example

43

It makes that much difference?

49
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:28,130
It adds gloss and will tone up your skin

50
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,400
This makes your skin glossy

51
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:34,370
eh doesn't makeup-san do this for you? You do this yourself?

52
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:34,850
I do it myself

53

Switch over to this stuff and its "you've become mega cute"

58

the fans will say this to you

59

As for powders...the white types

when you're adding color

61
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,630
the foundation is the base color

62
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:56,180
so it becomes meaningless

63
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:58,900
Now for the next step

You've mentioned that your bangs always have that soaking wet look right

67

I'll add some to your hair

70
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:19,470
Doing this will help keep your bangs from getting dried out

71
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:23,020
I'll add highlights now...highlights are crucial

72
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:26,020
You have a high nose so you don't need so much

73
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:28,060
If I cover the entire area

74
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:30,240
it'll make your nose look stretched out

75
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:32,740
So just in this upper area

76
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:34,740

if you use a brown color

79
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:41,120
a black mascara would make everything look tight

80
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,590
Basically both the eyeliner and mascara should be brown colors

81

Feels moist right?

82
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,610

[ Lightly remove the foundation to apply lipstick directly ]

85
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:56,900

This is Shiraishi Mai's...I want to do a comedy sketch

188
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,800
This time Shiraishi wanted to perform in a comedy sketch

189
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,070
so she gave these comedians an offer

190
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:25,100
Its these people...

191
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:30,000
Kanda has this great ramen place....let's go there

192
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,470
Hold on now...come over here

193
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:33,060
This is the place

So how come

you want to do a sketch with us?

201
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:53,010
Well recently we've worked together a lot

202
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:56,130
I've also gone to see your live show

203
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:58,820
from that I've totally gotten into your comedy

204
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:01,390
This time I definitely wanted to work with you

205
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:03,120
So you don't look at us like fresh new talent then

206

207

named Sironne

212
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:16,180
That sounds kind of delicious

00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:19,540
Something you'd eat in Nagoya

214
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:23,260
And with that...to create a comedy sketch

215
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:24,510

216

217
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,400
What kind?

218
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:31,170
I like the out of control ones

By the way...between setup man and straight man

222
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:39,390
which role do you prefer?

223
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:42,080
There aren't any girls who want the straight man role

224
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,270
I've never heard of such a thing

225

Put me in your sketch...I want to do the grunt work!

226
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:49,970
It could happen...I'll be in charge of moving the story along

227

I don't have much confidence with this

228

I'd prefer doing the setup

229
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:56,620
But with Shiraishi-san we could

230
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:59,950
I'd like to see you act all emotional

231
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:01,500
I don't get to do that much

232
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,500
You're in charge of doing cold stares right?

233
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,730
Its those cold stares right

And then also

237
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:14,800
tell us what's off limits for you

239
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:18,430

[ She will not expose her butt ]

She can't expose her butt then

243
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:26,980

The theme is based on [Shiroi Kyoto]

247
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,520
ah that's right

252

Could you make it more tragic sounding?

For the line "Its all my fault"?
