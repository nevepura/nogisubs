370
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:36,570
so I started speaking up a bunch

371
00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:40,610
and it felt like I was getting a lot of chances here

372
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:41,420
In the future as well

373
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:43,050
I'm staying in show business so I'll do my best

374
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:43,850
You're doing it then

375
00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:44,670
ah that's great

376
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,830
I'm thinking it'll be little by little

377
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,850
We'll probably meet up again somewhere

378
00:23:48,850 --> 00:23:50,880
Also there were all kinds of

379
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:54,550
episodes that you helped with behind the scenes

380
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:57,210
If you ever need a year end "Nogizaka46 trendy words of the year award" episode

381
00:23:57,210 --> 00:24:01,260
[ Self-promotion ]

382
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:03,210
hai arigatou gozaimashita

383
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:04,050
otsukaresama

384
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:06,230
arigatou gozaimasu....otsukaresama deshita

385
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:07,000
And Saito Yuuri

386
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,970
yes you've taken good care of me all the way from NogiDoko to NogiChuu

387
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:13,460
To all the fans that watched....arigatou gozaimasu

388
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:16,300
My favorite episodes from NogiChuu

389
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:17,800
the game episodes

390
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:20,640
The competition where you split us up between the Himura unit

391
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,580
and Shitara-unit....there were a bunch of those episodes

392
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:24,250
In your track suits

393
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:25,270
That's right

394
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:27,780
So those allowed us to move around

395
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:30,700
I thought those episodes were so much fun

396
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:34,370
To not do those anymore kind of makes me sad but

397
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:36,060
since I'll still be in show business

398
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:36,890
ah really

399
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:37,360
hai

400
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:40,090
I'll be doing the best I can from here on out

401
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,050
Really the 2 of you

402
00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:43,420
you 2 are so cheerful

403
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:45,210
Yes they brighten up everything

404
00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:46,780
You really helped us out

405
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:49,060
It'll be gloomy from now on without them

406
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:51,990
I don't think that'll happen

407
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:53,870
arigatou gozaimasu

408
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:54,760
Ito Karin

409
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:55,700
Saito Yuuri

410
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:57,240
Congratulations on your graduations!

411
00:24:58,380 --> 00:24:59,270
