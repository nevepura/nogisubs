00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:39,580
<font size="46"><b>Alright.</b></font>

10
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:42,160
<font size="46"><b>So you're doing a concert in Shizuoka?</b></font>

11
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,880
<font size="46"><b>Yes. On the 15th and 16th.</b></font>

12
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,490
<font size="46"><b>And that's your last appearance for Nogizaka?</b></font>

13
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:46,700
<font size="46"><b>Yes, it will all end with that.</b></font>

14
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:47,590
<font size="46"><b>The end.</b></font>

15
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:48,970
<font size="46"><b>So you only have a few days left.</b></font>

16
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:49,720
<font size="46"><b>Yes.</b></font>

17
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:53,870
<font size="46"><b>So today is also the last time you're appearing here as a member of Nogizaka, right?</b></font>

18
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:53,900
<font size="46"><b>Yes, it's the last.</b></font>

19
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:54,740
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="44">Last Under Construction</font>

20
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:56,400
<font size="46"><b>I see.</b></font>

21
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:56,760
<font size="46"><b>Right?</b></font>

22
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:57,500
<font size="46"><b>The last, huh.</b></font>

23
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:00,820
<font size="46"><b>We've been doing this together for a long time, so it'll be lonely without you.</b></font>

24
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:02,120
<font size="46"><b>Ve-Yes, it's sad.</b></font>

25
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:02,980
<font size="46"><b>What's with the Ve?</b></font>

26
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:04,440
<font size="46"><b>Was gonna say very sad.</b></font>

27
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,410
<font size="46"><b>So it was Ve from very.</b></font>

28
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:06,510
<font size="46"><b>Yes, a Ve from very.</b></font>

29
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:06,920
<font size="46"><b>I see.</b></font>

30
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:09,480
<font size="46"><b>Even the inside of my mouth is fat so I stumble over my words.</b></font>

31
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,080
<font size="46"><b>Fukagawa has been accompanied by her endearing title of "Holy Mother."</b></font>

32
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,380
<font size="46"><b>With her graduation, the seat for Nogizaka's "Holy Mother" character will be vacated.</b></font>

33
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:23,130
<font size="46"><b>To fill in that hole, an audition for the second Holy Mother will be held tonight.</b></font>

34
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:26,400
<font size="46"><b>The ones who have put forth themselves as the ones who deserve the title are:</b></font>

35
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,280
<font size="46"><b>Akimoto, Ikuta, and Hori.</b></font>

00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,510
<font size="46"><b>Tonight, the second Holy Mother shall be chosen from these three.</b></font>

37
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:38,340
<font size="46"><b>All of you. A Holy Mother will be picked from these three. A new one.</b></font>

38
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:41,050
<font size="46"><b>It looks to me like everyone has objections about the choices.</b></font>

39
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:42,000
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="44">Why these 3?</font>

40
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,930
<font size="46"><b>The air is filled with the question "Why these three?"</b></font>

41
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:46,290
<font size="46"><b>Please leave it to me.</b></font>

42
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:46,490
<font size="46"><b>Wow.</b></font>

43
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:47,500

45
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:50,250
<font size="46"><b>Well...</b></font>

46
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:51,000
<font size="46"><b>She's not fooling around, is she?</b></font>

47
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,300
<font size="46"><b>No, I think it's fine.</b></font>

48
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:58,440
<font size="46"><b>First, these three will state how they deserve to become Nogizaka's Holy Mother.</b></font>

49
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:02,440
<font size="46"><b>Our top batter is Akimoto Manatsu.</b></font>

50
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:05,940
<font size="46"><b>Let us hear her reason for running for the position of Nogizaka's Holy Mother.</b></font>

51
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:08,340

52
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:11,110
<font size="46"><b>For Halloween, we all did cosplay, didn't we?</b></font>

53
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:15,810
<font size="46"><b>At that time, I unknowingly did something...</b></font>

54
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:18,450
<font size="46"><b>I'd like everyone to please take a look at what I mean. Jan!</b></font>

55
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,620
<font size="46"><b>I did a cosplay of a Sister.</b></font>

56
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:23,870
<font size="46"><b>Oh.</b></font>

57
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:23,880
<font size="46"><b>When I did this, I had no idea this would happen.</b></font>

58
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,160
<font size="46"><b>Sister.</b></font>

<font size="44">Around 2 years ago, she somehow did a cosplay of a Sister!</font></font></font></font>

60
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:30,080
<font size="46"><b>I had absolutely no idea that we would be holding an audition for the second Holy Mother.</b></font>

61
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:30,960
<font size="46"><b>But somehow!</b></font>

62
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:31,860
<font size="46"><b>You were already there.</b></font>

63
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:36,310
<font size="46"><b>Unknowingly, I chose this costume out of the many choices available.</b></font>

64
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:38,800
<font size="46"><b>I became a Holy Mother.</b></font>

65
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:41,220
<font size="46"><b>And so, with that...</b></font>

66
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:45,110
<font size="46"><b>I was guided by the Holy Mother, and wore that costume.</b></font>

67
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:48,110
<font size="46"><b>And now, I'm here taking this audition.</b></font>

68
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:50,020
<font size="46"><b>It's like you were guided by some natural power.</b></font>

69
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:54,460
<font size="46"><b>Yes. Even years ago, I felt a pull, like a calling.</b></font>

70
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:56,990
<font size="46"><b>And so I ended up wearing this then.</b></font>

71
00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:01,990
<font size="46"><b>And Akimoto has one more reason...</b></font>

73
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:07,510

74
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:13,210
<font size="46"><b>There's a part of the current Holy Mother, Maimai, that's coming closer and approaching me.</b></font>

<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="44">The person herself is shocked!</font>

<font size="46"><b>Yes.</b></font>

00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:15,800
<font size="46"><b>Maimai's shocked.</b></font>

78
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,110
<font size="46"><b>No, no, no.</b></font>

79
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:18,510
<font size="46"><b>She's surprised.</b></font>

80
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:23,520
<font size="46"><b>What is this approach that Akimoto felt from Fukagawa?</b></font>

81
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:28,720
<font size="46"><b>Normally, when we're waiting, I usually go tsuntsun and chu like this.</b></font>

82
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,550
<font size="46"><b>And somehow, this has infected Maimai as well!</b></font>

83
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:35,320
<font size="46"><b>She has come to regularly go tsuntsun and chu as well.</b></font>

84

<font size="46"><b>I'm not just naming myself Holy Mother, the Holy Mother herself is approaching me.</b></font>

86
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:42,000
<font size="46"><b>I believe this means I'm already a Holy Mother at this point.</b></font>

87
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,160
<font size="46"><b>Like you're meant to be the Holy Mother.</b></font>

<font size="46"><b>Yes.</b></font>

89

<font size="46"><b>Did you notice this yourself?</b></font>

90
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:48,800
<font size="46"><b>Well, now that it's mentioned, I guess I've noticed this myself too.</b></font>

91
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:53,910
<font size="46"><b>Like when I go to tease Manatsu I go tsun! and I think, "Oh, I just said that."</b></font>

92

<font size="46"><b>I guess... When it's put that way, I may actually be kind of approaching her...</b></font>

93
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:55,660
<font size="46"><b>Cute!</b></font>

94

96
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:12,460
<font size="46"><b>But I believe I do actually have the what it takes to be one.</b></font>

97
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:16,750
<font size="46"><b>I would like to talk more about what this is from here on.</b></font>

98
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:17,260
<font size="46"><b>I see.</b></font>

99
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:20,960

103
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:30,240
<font size="46"><b>Perfume... She always smells really good, so I think she always brings her perfume with her.</b></font>

104
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,890

111
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:43,790

112
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:46,340
<font size="46"><b>I like chocolate so I usually have quite a bit of it in my bag.</b></font>

<font size="46"><b>Is that so?</b></font>

114
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,400
<font size="46"><b>And you give it out to everyone?</b></font>

115
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,450
<font size="46"><b>When the members say they're hungry, I give it out to them.</b></font>

121
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,400
<font size="46"><b>What is it?</b></font>

122
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,540
<font size="46"><b>Snacks.</b></font>

123
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:07,180

124
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:12,590
<font size="46"><b>However, thus far, I haven't actually had the chance to share them with anyone...</b></font>

00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:15,240
<font size="46"><b>Aren't those for your own consumption?</b></font>

128
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:19,600
<font size="46"><b>No, no. It's so that I can deliver when the need arises.</b></font>

129
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,560

00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:24,260
<font size="46"><b>Even though I live in Shizuoka, I always looked forward to seeing your smile on TV, in magazines, and on the internet.</b></font>

550
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:28,180
<font size="46"><b>So those days were also very fulfilling for me.</b></font>

551
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:33,490
<font size="46"><b>In that time, there were happy times, fun times, and there were times you called me on the phone while crying...</b></font>

552
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:37,640
<font size="46"><b>Whenever you were down, I got worried and wanted so much to just rush to your side...</b></font>

553
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:46,850
<font size="46"><b>but instead I told you on the other side of the phone line how I wished that tomorrow you could do your best again with a smile, that you could believe in yourself and keep working.</b></font>

554
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:52,790
<font size="46"><b>I see all the members of Nogizaka as if they were my children and they are very dear to me.</b></font>

555
00:21:52,790 --> 00:22:01,400
<font size="46"><b>I believe it's also because you always had the best, most wonderful friends by your side that you were able to overcome a lot of hardships.</b></font>

556
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:08,420
<font size="46"><b>It would be great if you could still keep in touch from time to time even10 or 20 years from now and keep on being friends, wouldn't it?</b></font>

557
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:13,340
<font size="46"><b>I'm looking forward to the path I'll be walking with you from here on as well.</b></font>

558
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:17,320
<font size="46"><b>Let's go on a trip together again, okay? Love, Mom.</b></font>

559
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,940
<font size="46"><b>So there were times you cried while talking to her on the phone?</b></font>

560
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:27,250
<font size="46"><b>Yes.</b></font>

561
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:32,240
<font size="46"><b>Well, I believe all of the members have it tough when it comes to worries about work...</b></font>

562
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:36,140
<font size="46"><b>So, it's like, there are things I can't bother other members with...</b></font>

563
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:41,160
<font size="46"><b>So, I... When I reach my limit, I would often call my mother then and ask her to listen to me.</b></font>

564
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:46,920
<font size="46"><b>It seems your mother also wanted to rush to your side, but she endured it and talked to you on the phone instead.</b></font>

565
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:54,010
<font size="46"><b>Finally, we have some words of gratitude from Fukagawa for the other members and for the fans.</b></font>

566
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:57,660
<font size="46"><b>Um, first, to all the members...</b></font>

567
00:22:57,660 --> 00:23:02,050
<font size="46"><b>Well, it's not that we won't see each other anymore after this recording...</b></font>

568
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:05,250
<font size="46"><b>But when I graduate... well...</b></font>

569
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:12,360
<font size="46"><b>Then those fun times we spend while we're in the waiting room...</b></font>

570
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:15,720
<font size="46"><b>Like... Even outside work...</b></font>

571
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:19,930
<font size="46"><b>Those times we spent outside work were really a lot of fun for me...</b></font>

572
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:27,160
<font size="46"><b>So when I think about how I won't be able to experience those fun and lively times anymore when I become alone...</b></font>

573
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:30,720
<font size="46"><b>I feel really sad... But... Well...</b></font>

574
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:38,430
<font size="46"><b>It's not like we'll never see each other again, so... I hope I could keep on being friends with everyone for a very long time from here on as well.</b></font>

575
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:49,200
<font size="46"><b>And... For the all the fans watching the show who have supported me... Um... Starting from "Where is Nogizaka?"</b></font>

576
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:56,270
<font size="46"><b>At the beginning, I felt like I wasn't very good with variety shows, but with our very warm staff...</b></font>

577
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:59,120
<font size="46"><b>and Bananaman-san, and with all of the members...</b></font>

578
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:06,260
<font size="46"><b>I was able to be at ease in our recordings for around 4 and a half years, and I always looked forward to our recording sessions.</b></font>

579
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:11,570
<font size="46"><b>From here on, I would like to support this show as a viewer...</b></font>

580
00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:16,610
<font size="46"><b>So, everyone, please keep on supporting Nogizaka46 from here on as well. Thank you very much.</b></font>

581
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:38,960
<font size="46"><b>Congratulations!</b></font>



585
00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:44,060
<font size="46"><b>And that's that...</b></font>

586
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:47,130
<font size="46"><b>So for the last time, let's have Fukagawa end the show for us.</b></font>

587
00:24:47,130 --> 00:24:48,860
<font size="46"><b>Everyone, thank you very much!</b></font>

588
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:51,690
<font size="46"><b>And please watch Nogizaka Under Construction next week as well!</b></font>

589
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:52,760
<font size="46"><b>Until next time!</b></font>

590
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,860
<font size="46"><b>Thank you very much!</b></font>

591
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:57,410
