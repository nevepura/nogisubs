84

00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:17,310
<font size="70"><b>They did say "Ikoma ran away" but I actually didn't just run away...</b></font>

86
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:23,020
<font size="70"><b>Behind all that, there was a reason that would really make you want to run...</b></font>

87
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:23,610
<font size="70"><b>So something happened.</b></font>

88
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:28,140
<font size="70"><b>So if you watch this, you'll find out why I ended up behaving that way at that time...</b></font>

89
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:29,020
<font size="70"><b>So the camera caught that too.</b></font>

90
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:29,460
<font size="70" color="#d9c9e5"><b>Yes, it did.</b></font>

91
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:30,620

92
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:32,960

93
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,060
<font size="70"><b>So of course, even fans don't know the reason.</b></font>

94
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:37,840
<font size="70"><b>Yes. I believe there are more people who don't know the reason...</b></font>

95
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:43,000
<font size="70"><b>And it's not just about me, it's related to Macchun as well and she appears in the scene...</b></font>

96
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:45,130
<font size="70"><b>So you were there too, Matsumura?</b></font>

97
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:46,930

99
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,570

100
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:53,440
<font size="70"><b>She says you were there though!</b></font>

101
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:57,860

00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:01,280
<font size="70"><b>It's all shown there so this is definitely a scene to look out for.</b></font>

<font size="70"><b>They went to Osaka for Naachan too.</b></font>

140
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,060
<font size="70"><b>Ah, I see, I see.</b></font>

141
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:16,930
<font size="70"><b>So you have a ski scene.</b></font>

142
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:21,970
<font size="70"><b>Ski scene. You'll see me getting excited like a kid.</b></font>

143
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:24,530
<font size="70"><b>So beautiful!</b></font>

144
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:32,310
<font size="70"><b><i>Next, we have Shiraishi's recommended scenes.</i></b></font>

145
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:33,650
<font size="70"><b>Ready, start!</b></font>

146
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:36,350
<font size="70"><b>The scenes that hit me hard were... First is this.</b></font>

147
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:41,050
<font size="70"><b>For our first ever request hour, Ikoma-chan was really nervous and Minami softly pat her back.</b></font>

148
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:42,290
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="66"><font face="Arial Unicode MS"><font color="#030202"><font size="55">request hour</font></font></font></font>

149
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:43,060
<font size="70"><b>So these are their backs?</b></font>

150
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:43,840
<font size="70"><b>Yes.</b></font>

151
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,390
<font size="70"><b>It's a light but really touching scene...</b></font>

152
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:49,560
<font size="70"><b>so, I hope everyone watches it.</b></font>

153
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,740
<font size="70"><b>And another is this.</b></font>

154
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:54,330
<font size="70"><b>Ikoma-chan also mentioned this earlier.</b></font>

155
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:57,060
<font size="70"><b>A full story that has something to do with Matsumura as well.</b></font>

156
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:00,170
<font size="70"><b>It's a really serious and tense scene...</b></font>

157
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:01,740
<font size="70"><b>Isn't Matsumura's face there too long?</b></font>

158
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:03,630
<font size="70"><b>My chin!!!</b></font>

159
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:04,910
<font size="70"><b>Alright, time's up!</b></font>

160
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:08,320
<font size="70"><b>You were too slow, Shiraishi!</b></font>

161
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,220
<font size="70"><b>Your drawings make the scene look funny instead though.</b></font>

162
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:10,220
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="66">No convincing power.</font>

163
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:11,920
<font size="70"><b>This one's Matsumura, right?</b></font>

164
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,300
<font size="70"><b>Yes. I wrote their names.</b></font>

165
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:16,200
<font size="70"><b>Matsumura, Hashimoto, Ikoma...</b></font>

166
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,370
<font size="70"><b>and Shiraishi.</b></font>

167
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:19,390
<font size="70"><b>Ah, so this is Hashimoto. I thought it was...</b></font>

168
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:22,390
<font size="70"><b>Is that the running away scene Ikoma mentioned earlier?</b></font>

169
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:25,760
<font size="70"><b>It's a scene from the same time that has something to do with it.</b></font>

170
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,240
<font size="70"><b>It's quite something, they showed it without cutting at all.</b></font>

171
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,780
<font size="70"><b>That's why, it's a really serious and tense scene.</b></font>

172
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:33,480
<font size="70"><b>So it's a serious scene.</b></font>

173
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,270
<font size="70"><b>Yes, seriously, I think it's the biggest highlight.</b></font>

174
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:36,960
<font size="70"><b>But I got the positioning of the hands and all perfectly, right?</b></font>

175
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,580
<font size="70" color="#d9c9e5"><b>Yes, it's perfect.</b></font>

176
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:38,580
<font size="70" color="#d9c9e5"><b>That does look like Mattsun, it really does.</b></font>

177
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:39,690
<font size="70"><b>Yeah, always there.</b></font>

178
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:40,560
<font size="70"><b>Yes.</b></font>

179
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,650
<font size="70"><b>And for Nanamin too, her dress's zipper at the back was open so it's quite loose.</b></font>

180
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:45,900
<font size="70"><b>Wow, amazing!</b></font>

181
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:49,460
<font size="70"><b>We were wearing the Guruguru Curtain outfit...</b></font>

182
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:52,120
<font size="70"><b>That part's amazing, so it's really a scene to watch out for, huh?</b></font>

183
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,120
<font size="70"><b>It does seem so.</b></font>

184
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:53,820
<font size="70"><b>Yes.</b></font>

185
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:56,530
<font size="70"><b>It's the scene I'd like most for everyone to watch.</b></font>

186
00:06:56,530 --> 00:06:58,920
<font size="70"><b>So what about everyone aside from you?</b></font>

187
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,070
<font size="70"><b>But everyone... Everyone else...</b></font>

188
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:03,370
<font size="70"><b>Don't go saying sad things like "everyone else"!</b></font>

189
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:04,570
<font size="70"><b>Like for Unders...</b></font>

190
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:08,570
<font size="70"><b><i>Next. Nishino's recommended scenes.</i></b></font>

191
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:09,970
<font size="70"><b>Ready, start!</b></font>

192
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:13,340
<font size="70"><b>Yes. After watching this movie, 
my thought was... People change.</b></font>

193
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:14,170
<font size="70"><b>Um...</b></font>

194
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:14,740
<font size="70"><b>People are frogs (kaeru)?</b></font>

195
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:15,540
<font size="70"><b>Change (kawaru).</b></font>

196
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:19,280
<font size="70"><b>They change on the inside as well as on the outside.</b></font>

197
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,730
<font size="70"><b>For the outside, one of the changes were that we used to have thin eyebrows.</b></font>

198
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:26,220
<font size="70"><b>I think back when we auditioned, thin eyebrows were in fashion so we all had thin eyebrows.</b></font>

199
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:28,580
<font size="70"><b>Next is... My grandfather makes an appearance.</b></font>

200
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:31,980
<font size="70"><b>My grandfather made his first movie appearance!</b></font>

201
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:34,340
<font size="70"><b>I tried drawing my grandpa.</b></font>

202
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:36,960
<font size="70"><b>So good!</b></font>

203
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:40,030
<font size="70"><b>Grandpa's eating!</b></font>

204
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:41,150
<font size="70"><b>This is my grandpa.</b></font>

205
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:42,700
<font size="70"><b>He's eating something, he's eating something.</b></font>

206
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:43,770
<font size="70"><b>Alright, time's up.</b></font>

207
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:45,740
<font size="70"><b>Aaah, time's up.</b></font>

208
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:47,780
<font size="70"><b>So good!</b></font>

209
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:49,420
<font size="70"><b>We went to grandpa's house...</b></font>

210
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:50,820
<font size="70"><b>Eh? So you filmed there too?</b></font>

211
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:56,980
<font size="70"><b>Yes. So we went to grandpa's house and there was a scene where I, my dad, and my grandpa were eating Nabe.</b></font>

212
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:58,370
<font size="70"><b>This is grandpa in that scene.</b></font>

213
00:07:58,370 --> 00:07:59,120
<font size="70"><b>So the movie has scenes like that too.</b></font>

214
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,390
<font size="70"><b>Does it have like, for example, scenes from Macau?</b></font>

215
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:03,530
<font size="70"><b>It did.</b></font>

216
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:04,880
<font size="70"><b>Oh, so it has that part where you jumped.</b></font>

217
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,080
<font size="70"><b>The video, yes.</b></font>

218
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:06,930
<font size="70"><b>Ohhh, that part!</b></font>

219
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:09,120
<font size="70"><b>This camera, the ugly face camera.</b></font>

220
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,860
<font size="70"><b>No, no, that was great.</b></font>

221
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:12,360
<font size="70"><b>That's included.</b></font>

222
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,170
<font size="70"><b>That was a great scene.</b></font>

223
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:19,790
<font size="70"><b><i>Please look for Nishino's grandpa in the actual movie.</i></b></font>

224
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:43,440
<font size="70"><b><i>Akimoto's recommended scenes from the Nogizaka movie are...</i></b></font>

225
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,470
<font size="70"><b>Ready, start!</b></font>

226
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:48,360
<font size="70"><b>Yes. First, I'll be introducing 3 big surprises in this movie.</b></font>

227
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:51,460
<font size="70"><b>The first is, even though this is a Nogizaka movie...</b></font>

228
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:55,380
<font size="70"><b>The first person who appears is someone not from Nogizaka. This is the shocking truth.</b></font>

229
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:56,720
<font size="70"><b>Right, next.</b></font>

230
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:01,680
<font size="70"><b>This here is our first photo from when we passed the auditions.</b></font>

231
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,780
<font size="70"><b>Looking at this, the shocking truth will be revealed.</b></font>

232
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:07,160
<font size="70"><b>Right, moving on.</b></font>

233
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,820
<font size="70"><b>The last is this.</b></font>

234
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:10,700
<font size="70"><b>This is the ending credits.</b></font>

235
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:14,460
<font size="70"><b>Before the ending credits, there are lots of points that will make you cry...</b></font>

236
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:16,100
<font size="70"><b>Alright, time's up.</b></font>

237
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:19,270
<font size="70"><b>...you'll still keep crying even then, it's a great movie like that!</b></font>

238
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:21,740
<font size="70"><b>Like, there's something after the credits?</b></font>

239
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:21,740
<font size="70"><b>Even during the ending credits, you'll be crying so much that you won't be able to read it.</b></font>

240
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:23,790
<font size="70" color="#d9c9e5"><b>So when everything finishes...</b></font>

241
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:26,980
<font size="70"><b>Seriously?</b></font>

242
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:29,220
<font size="70"><b>So that's what you meant. Not that there's some kind of trick or something.</b></font>

243
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:29,870
<font size="70"><b>Not that...</b></font>

244
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:31,210
<font size="70"><b>This one, what is it?</b></font>

245
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:32,970
<font size="70"><b>This is from when we passed the auditions...</b></font>

246
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:37,660
<font size="70"><b>We had a photo where we were all lined up and it was published in newspapers and such.</b></font>

247
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,930
<font size="70"><b>There's one there with a really big head, huh?</b></font>

248
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:41,340
<font size="70"><b>That is actually me.</b></font>

249
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:42,190
<font size="70"><b>As expected.</b></font>

250
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:45,260
<font size="70"><b>And with this, when I went to school the next day, my friend said...</b></font>

251
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:49,130
<font size="70"><b>"Manatsu, you were the only one who had kind of a bigger face, huh?"</b></font>

252
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:51,180
<font size="70"><b>So people will see this once again in the movie.</b></font>

253
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:53,990
<font size="70"><b>During that time, my friends actually quite often called me...</b></font>

254
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:56,290
<font size="70"><b>They called me "Flat head."</b></font>

255
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:56,310
<font size="70"><b>Flat head?</b></font>

256
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:56,880
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="66">Flat head?</font>

257
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,760
<font size="70"><b>Wait, if they were calling you that...</b></font>

258
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,690
<font size="70"><b>They were already making fun of you huh.</b></font>

259
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:02,450
<font size="70"><b>What does that even mean, flat head?</b></font>

260
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:06,040
<font size="70"><b>Like the top of my head is really flat so you can put 
anything on it, and everyone put books and stuff on it.</b></font>

261
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:06,600
<font size="70"><b>They did?</b></font>

262
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:06,990
<font size="70"><b>Yes.</b></font>

263
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:09,030
<font size="70"><b>Flat head? Let's try?</b></font>

264
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:10,300
<font size="70"><b>So, let's put that first.</b></font>

265
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,890
<font size="70"><b>Ah, she really is flat head.</b></font>

266
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:15,390
<font size="70"><b>Amazing!</b></font>

267
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:16,600
<font size="70"><b>Eh, so stable!</b></font>

268
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,710
<font size="70"><b>Flat-san!</b></font>

269

<font size="70"><b>Flat-san!!</b></font>

270
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:19,380
<font size="70"><b>Amazing.</b></font>

271
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:20,460
<font size="70"><b>Cool.</b></font>

272
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:21,710
<font size="70"><b>Really, that's quite something.</b></font>

273
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:22,210
<font size="70"><b>Yeah.</b></font>

274
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:22,920
<font size="70"><b>Amazing.</b></font>

275
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,040
<font size="70"><b>It seems like you could carry various stuff on your head.</b></font>

276
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,040
<font size="70"><b>Right? Maybe you could even carry water from 5 kilometers away.</b></font>

277

279
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:31,080

280
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,010

<font size="70"><b><i>Next up. We have Wada's recommended scenes.</i></b></font>

285

<font size="70"><b>Here we go. Ready, start!</b></font>

286
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,460
<font size="70"><b>What I thought after watching this movie was...</b></font>

287
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:52,430
<font size="70"><b>A long time ago, members from other regions lived in a dormitory...</b></font>

288
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:58,940
<font size="70"><b>And we had a dining table on the 
second floor, where we all talked until late...</b></font>

289
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:04,270
<font size="70"><b>Like "What do I do for my MC part in our concert?" "What do we do now?" "Delicious." and such.</b></font>

290
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:07,810
<font size="70"><b>Like, "I have clothes that I don't wear anymore, does anyone want it?"</b></font>

291
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:11,030
<font size="70"><b>So, I remembered us having those conversations before.</b></font>

292
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:15,080
<font size="70"><b>And the next, our vocal training teacher...</b></font>

293
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,350
<font size="70"><b>Alright, time's up!</b></font>

294
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:19,660
<font size="70"><b>That was really cute, but...</b></font>

295
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:22,350
<font size="70"><b>So it was your dorm memories? So that appears as well?</b></font>

296
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:24,500
<font size="70"><b>Yes. The dorm is shown.</b></font>

297
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,340
<font size="70"><b>Amazing, it has even that.</b></font>

298
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:26,930
<font size="70"><b>Yes.</b></font>

299
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:27,960
<font size="70"><b>So your vocal training teacher...</b></font>

300
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:30,440
<font size="70"><b>Our teacher was really scary.</b></font>

301
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,140
<font size="70"><b>Ah, I see.</b></font>

302
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:37,420
<font size="70"><b>But, earlier, I heard from my manager...</b></font>

303
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:41,150
<font size="70"><b>that this teacher is actually a very good teacher.</b></font>

304
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:46,040
<font size="70"><b>And that she said "I'm going to go into scary mode now" and went on to teach us.</b></font>

305
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:46,610
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="66">Actually a kind teacher.</font>

306
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:48,640
<font size="70"><b>I learned that just earlier.</b></font>

307
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:54,980
<font size="70"><b>Well, yeah, after all, you were all beginners...</b></font>

308
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:55,780
<font size="70"><b>Right?</b></font>

309
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:59,260
<font size="70"><b>So she probably got angry to help you become people who can sing songs.</b></font>

310
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:04,000
<font size="70"><b>So, the lessons were always so scary, and my stomach always hurt before them.</b></font>

311
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:04,850
<font size="70"><b>You didn't want to go?</b></font>

312
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:06,050
<font size="70"><b>Yeah.</b></font>

313
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:08,540
<font size="70"><b>But she was REALLY scary. Right?</b></font>

314
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:10,150
<font size="70"><b>She was.</b></font>

315
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:12,340
<font size="70"><b>Really scary.</b></font>

316
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:15,280
<font size="70"><b>I always wondered if it was menopause.</b></font>

317
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:15,600
<font size="70"><b>You'll get scolded for saying that just now.</b></font>

318
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,740
<font size="70" color="#d9c9e5"><b>Maaya-chan! Maaya-chan...</b></font>

319
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:20,820
<font size="70"><b>She's probably angry now with what you just said.</b></font>

320
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,360
<font size="70"><b>Your teacher just blew a fuse at that.</b></font>

321
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:29,300
<font size="70"><b><i>Please watch the members getting scared of their teacher in the actual movie.</i></b></font>

324
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:36,230

325

328

329
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,860

345
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:17,130

350
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:27,890
<font size="70"><b>But I'm curious about what made you laugh the most.</b></font>

351
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:28,820
<font size="70"><b>You got stopped there.</b></font>

352
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:32,620
<font size="70"><b>For this, I wanted... I thought I'd do something like a quiz afterwards.</b></font>

357
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,490
<font size="70"><b>Now I'm curious.</b></font>

358
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:46,260
<font size="70"><b>Right?</b></font>

359
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:48,240
<font size="70"><b>What do you think it was?</b></font>

360
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,310
<font size="70"><b>Eh, is that something we can guess... like...</b></font>

361
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:52,960
<font size="70"><b>Without any hint whatsoever?</b></font>

362
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:53,940
<font size="70"><b>Yes.</b></font>

363
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:55,580
<font size="70"><b>So it's something we can guess if we just think about it?</b></font>

364
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:57,940
<font size="70"><b>Ah, but it is something old people usually watch.</b></font>

365
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:58,580
<font size="70"><b>Old people.</b></font>

366
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:00,020
<font size="70"><b>Yes, yes, yes. That's a hint!</b></font>

367
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:01,720
<font size="70" color="#d9c9e5"><b>So old people usually watch it.</b></font>

368
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,510
<font size="70"><b>So it was shown there the whole time?</b></font>

369
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:04,190
<font size="70"><b>Alright, then let's say our guesses at the same time.</b></font>

370
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:04,940

376
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,720

377
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,880
<font size="70"><b>It was Hakuho wiping his body!</b></font>

378

380

00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:45,810
<font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="66">A problem with the model?</font>

428
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:47,870
<font size="70"><b>No, your drawing's at fault here.</b></font>

429
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:48,760
<font size="70"><b>No, that's not it.</b></font>

430
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,690
<font size="70"><b>When you say "guts pose" people usually do this, right?</b></font>

431
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:51,320
<font size="70"><b>That's right.</b></font>

432
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:54,680
<font size="70"><b>So they wanted us to pose this way, like an idol...</b></font>

433
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:57,970
<font size="70"><b>But Nanamin alone did a rather strange guts pose...</b></font>

434
00:15:57,970 --> 00:15:58,850
<font size="70"><b>How so?</b></font>

435
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:02,900
<font size="70"><b>Like this, or like this... She was doing poses like those.</b></font>

436
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:05,710
<font size="70"><b>Like I was going to punch someone, right?</b></font>

437
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:09,480
<font size="70"><b>Not like a "I'll do my best!" kind of

438
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,680
<font size="70"><b>So that's what happened.</b></font>

439
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:13,490
<font size="70"><b>I never experienced getting my photo taken like that...</b></font>

440
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:18,610
<font size="70"><b>So, I asked the cameraman what kind of pose they were going to take and they said guts pose...</b></font>

441
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:20,690
<font size="70"><b>So I did this pose.</b></font>

442
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:24,560
<font size="70"><b>It's rare to see an idol doing this pose, right?</b></font>

443
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,560

444
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,880
<font size="70"><b>My face also changed.</b></font>

445
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:27,980
<font size="70"><b>Yeah.</b></font>

446
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:28,530
<font size="70"><b>My face...</b></font>

447
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:29,330
<font size="70"><b>Your face?</b></font>

448
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:30,370
<font size="70"><b>It has really changed.</b></font>

449
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:31,440
<font size="70"><b>Eh, so did you get it changed?</b></font>

450
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,840
<font size="70"><b>No, no.</b></font>

451
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,740
<font size="70"><b>It's okay, it's okay to do that though?</b></font>

452
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:38,780
<font size="70"><b>But really, I think once the movie comes out, people are going to say I had plastic surgery.</b></font>

453
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:40,110
<font size="70"><b>So you changed that much.</b></font>

454
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:41,890
<font size="70"><b>What changed?</b></font>

455
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:42,920
<font size="70"><b>I was all bloated.</b></font>

456
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:43,610
<font size="70"><b>So you were fat?</b></font>

457
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:45,080
<font size="70"><b>No she wasn't.</b></font>

458
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,280
<font size="70"><b>Everyone was kind of fatter then, right?</b></font>

459
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,350
<font size="70"><b>Only Hoshino got a little fatter, right?</b></font>

460
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:50,460
<font size="70"><b>Hey~!</b></font>

461

467
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:09,720
<font size="70"><b>Yes. The member I want everyone to watch the most in this movie is this...</b></font>

468
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:13,010

469

<font size="70"><b>So this girl, even though she's from Shounan...</b></font>

470
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:18,350
<font size="70"><b>For some reason, she took the audition in Fukuoka.</b></font>

471

<font size="70"><b>She went out of her way to take an overnight bus trip to take the audition in Fukuoka.</b></font>

472
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:25,990
<font size="70"><b>But actually, this girl was in an idol group in Fukuoka.</b></font>

473
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:27,470
<font size="70"><b>She was a local idol.</b></font>

474
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:32,600

479

481
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,110
<font size="70"><b>No, it's not like that. There's a proper punch line to this story.</b></font>

490
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:04,330

491

492
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:07,160
