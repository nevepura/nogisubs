 we don't know what the real smell is, right?</font>

00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:59,140

<font size="20">What does this mean?</font>

77
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:04,930

- Ah, so the middle part?</font>

<font size="20">- I love the smell of this center part. 
- If its the middle part...</font>

- How?</font>

80
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,670
<font size="20">It's not clear.</font>

81
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:14,040
<font size="20">But, Takayama said, "Ah ~" as if she knew.</font>

82

- Right.</font>

- Yes, right.</font>

84

85
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,250

86
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:24,250
<font size="20">Is there a characteristic for this?</font>

94
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:39,960

512
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,160
<font size="20">This segment is popular, right.</font>

513
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:11,000

518
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:29,390
<font size="20">Takayama is indeed like this segment.</font>

519
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:32,170
<font size="20">It was difficult though, because 
there are a lot of ideas that I have ...</font>

527
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:49,410
<font size="20">That's right, huh. Why did it happen?</font>

528
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:54,810
<font size="20">Since we changed to "Nogichuu", many segments of "NogiDoko" that we forget.</font>

529
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:59,790
<font size="20">But when you say it like this, of course 
we are happy, especially the staff.</font>

530
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:02,050
<font size="20">So they know, that there are great segments like this.</font>

531
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:05,280
<font size="20">So, we have to create something new, 
for a segment like this.</font>

532
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,980
<font size="20">Of course, if I want to do this Halloween.</font>
