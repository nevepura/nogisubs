its something I still worry about
I also don't come out well in photos

183
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:47,190
its something I still worry about

184
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:50,870
According to Cameraman-san, they'll say this angle is good for you

185
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:53,190
since many of them will tell me that

186
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:55,610
I've started to figure out my good angles

187
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,550
[ Takes cameraman opinions into account ]

188
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:00,660
Since your own opinion may not be the correct answer

189
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:03,610
Maybe when you're discussing your photos for your idol goods

190
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:07,030
you'll be like "Why did I come out looking like this"

191
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:08,610
You'll likely have to deal with that

192
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:11,200
I've already experienced that

193
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:14,590
I'm sure you've had to agree to do poses you don't agree with

194
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:16,510
However

195
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:20,770
it often happens that you'll think you look bad in something when its really not

196
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:22,790
Himura-san also

197
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:23,980
That's right. I've been through this

198
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:26,010
Sorry to talk like I'm at the same level as you are

199
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,700
But it happens to me too

200
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:31,410
Himura-san, even though he appears like a monster on the exterior

201
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:33,610
when he's getting his picture taken

202
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:36,260
there's certain pictures Himura-san hates personally

203
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:40,860
Like how his passport photo came out weird

204
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:44,230
Its like Sakurai was saying, you have an affinity for certain cameramen-san

205
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:47,300
and the cameraman I despise most, is that passport center cameraman

206
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:48,970
He's the worst

207
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:49,690

your passport or license photos are for identification

210
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,190
there's no need to look good in those

211
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:56,550
But the first thing he told me was to part my bangs

212
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,200
I moved my hair like pow-pow-pow

213
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:02,560
and he kept ignoring me

214
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:02,570
finally I stretched it out like streeetch
and he kept ignoring me

215

Eh? This is what you want?

217
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,670
Yes just like that is good

218
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:12,590
Then he asked me to draw in my chin

219
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:17,050
And he still brushed me off so I did this one

220
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:21,570
That's how it came out

221
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:24,980
That's on your passport for 10 years

222
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,530
Really can't stand it

223
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:30,100
I haven't seen much change in him

224
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:31,610
in how he looks

225
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:33,980
but he really hates pictures like that

226
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:35,190
It happens to Himura-san

227
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:53,480

Ah, this has to be something common

234
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:07,710
Are you running into people and such?

235
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:09,460

00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:11,180
we have our positions

237
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:15,750
there are times when someone will mistakenly end up in someone else's position

238
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:18,370
I'll think "What do I do now?"

239
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:21,450
and if she notices and we get out of sync

240
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:24,340
that mistake stays in my head

241
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:26,870
Ah, so it'll get progressively worse

00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,130

[ Can't do anything ]

But I don't believe a mistake is something that bad

Ah at that time

00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:21,350
doing everything perfect sounds good but

268
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:23,970
there's good points to seeing something not go right at a live

If you become too terrified to make a mistake

there's going to be times where it will cause you to freeze up

You have the intention to pay

I'll take out my money and from what's left

307
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:00,270
I'll think, I'm not going to use any more of it

308
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:03,370
so I won't put my money where the cash goes

309
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:05,500
i'll hide that money in another pocket

Trying to separate out the money you won't use

311
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:10,410
I separate it but

312
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:14,520
I'm like just a little bit is fine, and I'll gradually use all of it

313
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:15,970
until its all gone

314
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:17,960
What are you wasting your money on then?

315
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,810
Like clothes

316
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:21,640
and then frequent trips to the konbini

This is a common concern right

00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:30,080

She used to send money but would say

330
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:53,090
"Don't keep wasting your money on junk"

331
00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:53,990
Ah, that's right

332
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:56,790
When your parents give you money

333
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,190
they expect you to hold on to it, and you're telling her the money's all gone

334
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:02,970
I looked back at some of the texts with my mom

335
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:04,960

00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:06,710
For example?

337
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:10,250
Its mostly "stop wasting your money"

338
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:12,810
there was one time she used formal language on me

339
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:15,550

And that's when all the bills come in

348
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:38,620
I'll misunderstand how to use money

349
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:40,350
You misunderstand how to use it?

350
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:43,240

I save all my money in a jar

You get billed later on for online purchases right

354

Those bills come and I'll run out of money

355
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:00,310
So you get the money out of the piggy bank

00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:03,060

00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:40,310
Akimoto appears much bigger

536
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:44,670
When you did this trying to match up to the line, that's when I noticed it

537

when they showed that part on camera

538
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:52,700
I was watching the whole time

539
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:56,960
Both of you look down at the line to match up again

540
00:20:57,570 --> 00:20:59,330
Look, you can see the difference

541
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:02,960
Akimoto's head appears to be huge

542
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,630
She also seems to have more on the side

543
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,000
Why is that?

544
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:09,400
Well I really can't say why

545
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:15,580
She has no neck either!

546
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:19,470
Matsumura, what was that?

But really I think she has no neck

No neck right

551
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:28,880
And Mizuki-chan has a long neck

552
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,880
I don't see any problem with her balance

553
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,230
The balance is super good

554
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:35,840
But from here it really does appear like the same amount of largeness

555
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,800
Just Akimoto is a little huger

556
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:40,670
That's still bad, especially since you're sitting far away

But somehow Akimoto has taken this

560
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:48,530

But you have done something with it

564
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:55,380
That's right.  Saito Asuka for example

565
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:59,200
there's many times I'll have to stand next to small faced members

The times we have to line up for pictures

567
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,840
I'll also notice how short I am

568
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:10,580
when that happens and I have this internal conflict, I know I can't do anything about it

569
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:11,810
Doesn't matter right

570
00:22:11,810 --> 00:22:13,860

But to be serious, when we take pictures

574
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:25,610
and someone says that other girls face is so small, it makes me think YAY

575

But Takayama just said that

576
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:31,190
rather than trying to hide it by stepping back, the other way feels better for everyone

577

I just have one problem with that

578

Your concern then?

582
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:45,440
My concern is that Mizuki is so pretty

583
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,710
she's already gotten model work in magazines

584
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:51,240
Her visual appeal is already complete

Even if it is Akimoto we're talking about it, her head is actually small looking closely

they can tell at the handshake events

596
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:16,440
Its really surprising at the handshakes
