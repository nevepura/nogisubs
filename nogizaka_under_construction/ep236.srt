550
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:23,710
eh you write in that much detail

551
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:25,310
You read the whole thing?

552
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:27,080
Isn't that long?

553
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,600
eh no way

554
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:33,210
eh so how did the speech go?

555
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:37,800
While I was reading it from behind me

556
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:42,520
I could practically hear the crying from the other parents

557
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:44,320
everyone cried...

558
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,240
They were moved?

559
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:46,920
from your speech

560
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:58,720
So how does the speech start off?

561
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,710
The start

562
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:01,730
I want it to sound like a speech

563
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:04,850
The speech that reminds her of graduating

564
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:07,460
representing the graduates...Seimiya Rei

565
00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:10,420
Would you?

566
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:12,850
Commencement speech

567
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:15,220
Spring visited us early this year

568
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:17,860
already the cherry blossom petals are expanding

569
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:20,670
and even now they've started blooming

570
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:25,500
With dreams in our hearts we're about to go down the path we've selected for ourselves

571
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:28,160
it almost feels like a celebration

572
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,700
This is kind of nice

573
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,220
He's already crying

574
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:33,920
[ obasan moved to tears ]

575
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,200
ojisan...the ojisan

576
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:39,500
very nice

577
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,310
My favorite part

578
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:43,500
there's a part that made everyone cry

579
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:44,590
onegaishimasu

580
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:47,340
And now...as I calmly reflect back

581
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:49,980
what brought us to this day

582
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:51,710
was all the hardships

583
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:54,530
In troubled times they always watched over us

584
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:57,900
they were always there to help us...starting with school principal

585
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:01,500
all the different senseis...friends..and family

586
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,330
Even when we couldn't tell them everything

587
00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:06,610
they would always embrace us with their affection

588
00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:11,180
its because our families watched over us that we felt reassurance and could progress

589
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:12,530
sorry about this

590
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:14,180
ojisan over here isn't crying at all

591
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:15,660
[ Got tired of it? ]

592
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:20,340
He cried last time but the ojisan is not crying at all anymore

593
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:22,800
Did you write this yourself?

594
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:23,330
hai

595
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:25,010
seriously?

596
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:31,860
[ Next week is more 2019 class-B news ]

597
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:34,880
That...that's not class-B

598
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:36,660
A-grade

599
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:38,100
A-grade!
