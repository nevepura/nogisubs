A while back

16
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:40,030
magazine articles would write eyecatch headlines about the members in their articles

17
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:42,360
the headline would be based on their character

18
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,030
and were objectively written

19
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:47,050
This time we'll look back on those headlines

20
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:50,280
and the members will reconfirm their character as written in the article

21

The caption reads "She is owner of the strongest _____ in idol history"

24
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:02,910
So then we've covered up part of the headline

25
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:05,300
and before we read the real headline

26
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:09,020
We asked the members to fill out a survey where they filled in the blanks

27
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:12,220
The other members could probably accurately answer this

28
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:13,800
since they know how to describe each other

29
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,200

It seemed kind of like she was a heart sniper

so they put her in a cowboy outfit

and it was perfect, and since special move stuck out as a keyword

it made it into the article headline

150

more like how my emotions show in my expression

514
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:15,250
Well then

515
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:16,210
the answer

Well you've said a lot about everyone else

541
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,690
So here it is

542
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,240
When people see her they say [ ____ is a miracle ]

543

What could it be?

545
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:16,830
But first

546
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:18,400
here is Hori's answer

547
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:19,250
how she filled the blanks

When people see her they say [ The size of her face is a miracle ]

bishojo from another dimension

550
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:26,010
But you can see that

551

Well the size of her face

552
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,290
Hori, could you explain?

553
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:32,870
Sure, calling it a miracle

554
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:34,180
the size of her face

555
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:36,940
If you look at Asuka long enough, you get used to her face

556
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,570
but when you turn this way

557
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:41,320
its like "Her head is tiny"

558
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,650
Why are you comparing us!

559
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:49,500
But Nogizaka originally all of them looked tiny

560
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:51,310
but among them she stood out even more

561
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:53,310
like walking in the hallways from far away

562
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:55,370
you wouldn't notice when she walked right past

She's far away...far...far

564

Her face size

having large and small here makes it easy to see the difference

573
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:28,550
But really having extra small and extra large here with us

574
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:29,740
extra large!

575
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:33,340
Akimoto, she said it

looking at this pretty much

They think really hard to get these headlines

but with the writers, of course looking at their articles

592

its like ah, they use certain words with certain members

Up to this point they're able to see everything about me
