00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
-oohh.. oh..

6
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:24,000
ok.. ok.. ok.. ok..

7
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:27,000
uuuwwwuu

8
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:28,660
HAHAHAHAHAHA

9
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:31,790
-That was good

10
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:34,400
right, they are the present members in the studio

11
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:34,700
-mmhh

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:35,700
Today, what are we doing?

13
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:35,960
-Yes

14
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:37,900
Eh Himura-san, please announce it..

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,500
Let's get started. Today, The 1st...

16
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:41,960
Nogizaka46

17
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:45,200
PRIVATE MATTER MONOMANE TOURNAMENT

18
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:54,150
Members in the group are often good at imitations...

19
00:00:55,750 --> 00:01:01,400
Today, Nogizaka will detail private matters of members in a Monomane tournament

20
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:07,000
However, as a private matter they have to single out the important points.

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
uhm.. since its a private matter

22
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:13,610
Everyone, will bark at excitement! People watching TV will say "What the hell is this?"

23
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:14,800
Amusement required

24
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:15,610
-so.. so..

25
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:18,610
Japan, Absolutely promised...

26
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:21,630
...then, this guy and everyone, accepted power.

27
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:23,010
In a sense it's a team competition

28
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:23,800
-That is

29
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:24,500
-That's important.. That's important

30
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:27,810
That, in no way may not last barely

31
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:29,150
It's important.. It's important

32
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:34,300
First up these four what kind of monomane will they show us

33
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,600
The first monomane, is this!

34
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
-ah, Shiraishi

35
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:45,500
Example of Takayama Kazumi's hands when she's noisy.

36
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:46,000
-hahaha

37
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
-ah her legs are wide open

38
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:51,020
ah wait so listen...

39
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:53,020
before this Jo-san and I ate together right...

40
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:54,420
so

41
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:56,600
I asked for Lunch "A"

42
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,220
I wonder if it's quite okay?

43
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:02,540
When the clerk said "This... is good"

44
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:07,990
and at the end Lunch "E" came out.

45
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:11,300
-that was great

46
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,000
-amazing

47
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,350
everyone wants to see more

48
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,000
-ok I get it

49
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:16,800
-Let's keep going

50
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,200
-Lets's keep going

51
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,800
So let's keep going. Next monomane is this!

52
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,700
The action that she gives when she surely feels trouble or embarrassment by Akimoto Manatsu

53
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,000
I do not plan through more 20 minutes of Akimoto.

54
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:35,400
EEEHHH!!

55
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:39,000
Looks Good

56
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
-it's the same

57
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:42,900
Ahhh looks the same

58
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:45,300
ah I see, thats what it is

59
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,400
-I was surprised my own voice came out and heard it

60
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,700
-right? that was good...

61
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:51,400
Ok let's continue.. Next!

62
00:02:55,500 --> 00:03:02,700
Kawago Hina's not so much girl pose

63
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:06,000
The truth is.. honestly this year has gone by fast.

64
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,000
...Let me take a picture

65
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,000
i'm a model now so i'll go

66
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:14,000

67
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
BYEPICHI

68
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,550
Next monomane please!

69
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:32,200
Under Live "Senpuuki" Performance, faci...

70
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:37,000
...facial expression while dancing by Nakamto Himeka

71
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,500
-It's heeeeer!!

72
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:52,200
DOG?

73
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:54,000
First of Shiraishi

74
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
-Oh she was good

75
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,880
Shiraishi-Takayama

76
00:03:55,880 --> 00:04:01,000
Firstly your legs where too wide open...

77
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,100
-you really did it

78
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,880
You're normally good at monomane... like talking

79
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,300
-truly good

80
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:09,200
-She was, right? it was really amazing

81
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,200
It's like watching the real me

82
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,200
-"Watching the real you"???

83
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,200
You who?

84
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:16,900
no, that was just great

85
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,000
so that thing??

86
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:22,200
It's like her hands is following her voice

87
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,000
-I do.... yeah

88
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
-you really do

89
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,500
-I really do...

90
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,000
honestly.. this.. but.. of co..

91
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I'm staring at myself again...

92
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
but I didn't know I was doing it

93
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,370
you're doing it right now

94
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:36,800
Right of Freedom

95
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,900
"It was staring again"

96
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:41,700
Now Wakatsuki

97
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:41,900
yes

98
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
GOOD!

99
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,300
she always..

100
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:47,000
maybe

101
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,300
Your head... your head is big right?

102
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,560
maybe it wants freedom?

103
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:59,000
Prevention of head fall

104
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I saw..

105
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
on a photo, that a hand to the face lend a rough small face effect?

106
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:05,500
are you aiming for microcephaly effect?

107
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,200
(T/N: Microcephaly is a abnormal smallness of the head, a congenital condition associated with incomplete brain development.)

108
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,000
Comb the illusion

109
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:09,900
-Ahhhhh

110
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:11,950
Ohhhh

111
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:12,290
-Ahhhh

112
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,400
this is just a private matter of imitation, we're just getting started right Wada

113
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,000
Yes

114
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:25,300
yes.. this.. the fans absolutely don't know yet

115
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:26,000
-right

116
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
these days

117
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,300
her appeal is too great

118
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:34,900
The last part..

119
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,900
at the last part you said?

120
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,900
"BYEPICHI"

121
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:41,900
this is really... a lot hard

122
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
BYEPICHI what?

123
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,500
Bye bye and...? what do you think Himura-san?

124
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,500
Ehh.. Bye from "Bye-Bye" right?

125
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,500
you don't know what "PICHI" means right

126
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:52,500
So while walking...

127
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:56,000
She runs on a Pinch of crisis

128
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Narrow stride

129
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,500
-thats fast

130
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,000
-Bye-Pichi..

131
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
-Bye

132
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,800
-Bye-Bye.. while in a pinch?

133
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:03,600
Why BYEPICHI?

134
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,000
Why BYEPICHI?

135
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
"BYEPICHI" was when I was actually in Primary School

136
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,500
an old magazine called "Pichiremoso"

137
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:12,650
by taking the "PICHI"

138
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:14,000
i'm saying "BYEPICHI"

139
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,500
Why is it only Kawago's fault

140
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:21,500
Sometime I will come out to the members full throttle

141
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,700
so... Nakada, Himetan

142
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,000
-likely right?

143
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:25,880
-uhm..

144
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,500
-yeah likely

145
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,600
-there was that everyone went "Aaaaa"

146
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,600
that's right everyone went "Aaaa"

147
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,400
it's the intro for "Senpuuki"

148
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:36,400
first of her eyes as i thought its impossible

149
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,700
So i tried to look like it

150
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:39,600
Ah I understand

151
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,700
what do you think?

152
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:43,600
Ehh.. I think I just watched myself

153
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:44,300
A serious Problem

154
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,200
I didn't think it was like that

155
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:46,600
right?

156
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,600
maybe because you came in and out unconscious?

157
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,400
not unconscious, nothing like that

158
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:54,400
Himetan's tongue was a little sticking out

159
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:55,000
Himetan's case

160
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:55,600
-I know

161
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,100
-I know.. I know

162
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,800
Can you demonstrate it for us just a bit

163
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,300
Do it.. do it

164
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:00,300
Understood.. understood

165
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:01,200
-I want to see the exact way

166
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:09,990
Ah it came out

167
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,000
-So thats what  you mean

168
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,500
-Ahhhhhh

169
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,000
-Ah

170
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,850
that's why, because she's laughing

171
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,600
-right right

172
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,900
-AHHHHHH!!!!

173
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:19,100
It's out right?

174
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
-Ahh, because she was smiling too much

175
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,400
yes, like this

176
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,700
-I see! I see!

177
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,000
-Ahhhhhh

178
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,700
so that sort of face

179
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,000
ah so that's it

180
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Your tongue was really out

181
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,850
It was

182
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:35,000
why not make it more exaggerated?

183
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:41,530
Nogizaka46.

184
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:43,530

00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Next monomane are these three entries

187
00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:01,700
Takayam Kazumi mumbling to fans during handshake events.

188
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:06,000
Ohhh Kazumin do your best okay

189
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,300
Bye-bye.. bye-bye

193
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
-Ahhh I see...

Alright next monomane, is this!

197
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Hoshino Minami's "Promise" not to say the same thing over and over at an handshake event

198
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,900
Ah Minami please visit tokyo. Do your best okay

199
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:44,000
Thank you

200
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,600
Minami do your best in senbatsu okay

201
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,500
Yup

202
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,600
Thank you

203
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,500
Minami

204
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,600
Good luck on your next single

205
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,000
Minami! what's your favorite food?

206
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,400
Thank you

207
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,250
Ah! Pan!

208
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:55,200
Pan!

209
00:08:56,710 --> 00:09:00,000
Last minute Pan

210
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
so that's how you are in handshake events

211
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,960
Okay now next monomane, Go ahead

212
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:05,800
Alright

213
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,700
Nakamoto Himeka's "Ha line" beginning to sound like a shop during handshake event

214
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,700
Welcome

215
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:21,250
Ahhh

216
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:22,000
Hmmmmm

217
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,300
Himetan will do her best okay

218
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,150
Okaaaay!

219
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,700
Special "Ha" line

220
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:28,900
I see

221
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,600
Saito Chiharu went for Takayama

222
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,100
Yes

223
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:40,000
So whenever fans go to her she jumbles her words

224
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,500
Yes thats right

225
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:45,900
they're so fast they can't shake their hands properly

226
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:46,000
Baby hands Takayama

227
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,300
Amazing it looked like me..

228
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,450
aaaaamazing it was like me

229
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:52,000
Honestly it felt like me till the end..

230
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:52,700
nevertheless

231
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:53,400
time and time

232
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,000
We often practice hand swinging for handshake events

233
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,800
-Ahhh

234
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
then lately

235
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,500
it's like it shifted to doing something

236
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:07,450
Busy hands schedule

237
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:11,600
So that your handshaking you can do your "AMAZING!"

238
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,200
-yah yah yah yah yah

239
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,700
-that's great

240
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,600
Yah it's really great.. and fun

241
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,600
Uhm.. that's right she was amazing

242
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,650
Fast hands

243
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,650
and then Saito Yuri with Hoshino Minami

244
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:23,660
Yes

245
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:28,250
Hoshino's "hm.. hm.. thank you" is a little interval

246
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,500
feels something like that

247
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:33,000
while at it she also fixes her hair

248
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:38,000
-How about that food that she likes

249
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:41,500
ah that time "uh.. uh.. thank you. Ah! Pan! Pan!"

250
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:44,120
Time lag Pan

251
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,500
Not once but two pans

252
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,200
about this, do you know

253
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,200
I do say pan alot

254
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,400
Japanese Pan issues

255
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,700
-pan, your favorite is pan

256
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:55,900
But sometimes I worry

257
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:57,900
something like meat

258
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,900
It's like meat is inside my head

259
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,800
Clear the meat inside

260
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,200
They ask

261
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:06,400
"Did you have bread this morning?" something like that and I was like "Yeah! Bread!"

262
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:07,800
Wants to hear bread

263
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,100
So it want's to know if you had bread

264
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:13,300
and your voice was so little again

265
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,400
hm.. p..pan.. pan

266
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,500
correct correct

267
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:20,000
but lately my voice has been loud

268
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:20,500
right

269
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,100
so then your pan is loud?

270
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:22,350
-certainly

271
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,750
Lately it's been loud

272
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,950
Can you say "Pan" one more time?

273
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:26,900
PAN

274
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:27,350
-No no

275
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:28,000
Minimum Pan

276
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:28,550
-So little

277
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:29,400
-louder

278
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:31,100
-Ehh?!

279
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,600
like that Pan

280
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
PAN! like that. you let it out

281
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:37,270
ready.. go

282
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:38,500
PAN!

283
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,200
Limit of Hoshino

284
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,000
-so tiny so tiny

285
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,360
-right so tiny

286
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:41,630
-why?

287
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Oh someone came out again, Himetan

288
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,400
Inoue went for Himetan

289
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,700
Himetan's targeted a lot..

290
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,000
so Himetan's shop

291
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,500
Maybe beacuse she's always like this

292
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,900
Welcome!

293
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,500
cause it feels like a shop right...

294
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:58,700
She really does that?

295
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:00,000
She does face to face

296
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:01,900
welcome

297
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:02,700
-Hello

298
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,300
Ah first "Nice to meet you" then "Welcome!"

299
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:07,800
-Ehhhhhhh....

300
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,200
welcome huh

301
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,200
uhm at the handshake event

302
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:16,900
When she's alone... no not alone but when theirs 3 or 2 of us paired.

303
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,000
When a small child came she also went...

304
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,900
AH WELCOME!!!

305
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:24,300
the best in everyone

306
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,500
when I reply "Hee" or "Haa"

307
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:36,000
everyone want's to listen to the conversation and hear "Hee" or "Haa"

308
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:36,300
Correspondence to "Haa" line

309
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,900
Ahh so theirs unity

310
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:41,400
Maybe it has alleged breath leak

311
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:45,400
Out of Order?

312
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,900
I understand, I see

313
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:52,000
Himetan's hanging out tongue and leaking breath is making her look like a fool

314
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,800
-we don't really know that yet

315
00:12:55,100 --> 00:13:01,000
I'm not an idiot, I only look like one

316
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,600
there's something like that?

317
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:16,900
Lot's more of monomane are coming. Next up are these three entries

318
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:20,400
so so let's keep going next up is this!

319
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:30,500
13th single "Ima, Hanashitai Dareka Ga Iru" second verse Ikuta Erika's robotic like dance moves

320
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,100
-There's something like that?

321
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:50,800
-Wait, this one I wanna see

322
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,900
This one we don't know

323
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,000
I wanna see the real one

324
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,000
Next monomane please!

325
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:05,370
Takayama Kazumi's "Shi" during the unit song "Sakanatachi no LOVE SONG"

326
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:06,870
-Haha Takayam again

327
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,600
fukai kurayami ga

328
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:16,000
soko ni arimashita

329
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,100
Ahh they really did it

330
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:22,900
I saw myself

331
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:24,000
they really done it

332
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:26,300
Alright, next monomane is this!

333
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:34,000
Nakamoto Himeka responding to the fans even when the live show is finished

334
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:34,000
-Haha

335
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:34,600
-Himetan again haha

336
00:14:51,100 --> 00:15:04,700
Re-appeared

337
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:05,900
Alright Akimoto

338
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,000
the second verse of "Ima, Hanashitai Dareka Ga Iru"

339
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:12,220
Yes, the second verse doesn't really get shown in Shows

340
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:17,800
so in that on the extent of difficulty Iku-chan

341
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,800
other than that, it looks like she's trying to shake something off

342
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,600
the other members know all about this though

343
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,160
but it's still a little weird

344
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:29,690
Iku-chan, just drags her left leg

345
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:32,000
Broken over

346
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
you're suppose to move both your legs

347
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:39,000
I wonder why put the left leg behind

348
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I wonder too

349
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:43,800
Honestly I think Manatsu did well

350
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,300
Ikuta, what comes to your senses

351
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,400
That's right

352
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,600
My apologies I can't anymore I give up

353
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,200
Gracious decision

354
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,200
You can't do that

355
00:15:53,500 --> 00:16:08,000
We will now see Akimoto's exaggerated monomane dance

356
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
No way. You've got to be kidding me

357
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,500
for real? for real?

358
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,900
Ikuta, that just now was that for real?

359
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:15,900
it's different from the others

360
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:16,300
Same song?

361
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:17,400
Ikuta's the odd one

362
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,700
You're lying

363
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,400
That now was serious?!

364
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:21,970
that's how i do it

365
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:22,700
Seriously?!

366
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:23,000
it's real

367
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,450
This is bad it's like a horror movie

368
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:29,400
Ritual curse?

369
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:32,500
Furthermore I'm not even the most good in that position

370
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:33,400
wait a minute

371
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,000
wait

372
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:36,100
Eh why what's wrong?

373
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:39,400
wait a minute now, Hashimoto sorry but can you show us seriously this time

374
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,000
It's very different

375
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,600
It's kinda difficult

376
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,000
But this part was correct

377
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,000
wait Ikuta can you..

378
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:53,800
Ikuta your real you okay

379
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,680
Ready.... go

380
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:58,480
Scary.. scary... That's just scary

381
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,000
Demon advent dance

382
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:02,500
Why do this? why move like this?

383
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,200
why why

384
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:05,200
terrific

385
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,000
that was hilarious

386
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
you must do more...

387
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:11,700
I don't really know the second verse when not much done in live's

388
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:12,300
uhmm

389
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:14,200
so I'm not afraid to do at live's

390
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:19,000
So now to be honest you can do it in live's?

391
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,000
-you rehears that right?

392
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:22,000
Yes we do

393
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,300
-So you really do the second verse

394
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,700
We do, but not that much

395
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:24,700
-not that much

396
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:25,700
not that much

397
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,500
-ah that's a relief

398
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,400
-Do it....

399
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,000
Super dance.

400
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,800
we did it our handshake event

401
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,000
ah right we did

402
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
-ah so at the handshake event

403
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,800
you do the second verse at handshake events

404
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:38,500
-We do

405
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,200
Next Wada

406
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:42,700
Again with Takayama

407
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,700
Takayama is really popular

408
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:47,600
When ever she says the word "Shi"

409
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,300
it's Like a person without teeth at all...

410
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:51,000
Dentures feeling

411
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,520
that's the comparative strength to it?

412
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,400
it all went out in one breath

413
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,700
just like a grandma right

414
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:58,000
I first cannot say "sashisuse-so"

415
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:58,700
line of natural enemies.

416
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:00,000
you where just fast now

417
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,000
"sashisuse-so"

418
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,100
When I say "sashisuse-so"

419
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:07,700
I'll loose the sharpness of my breath

420
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
now, try for a little while

421
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:11,500
I can but...

422
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,500
the "sashisuse-so" ?

423
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,300
sashi... so..

424
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:14,800
that was real

425
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:15,300
one more

426
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:16,000
just relax

427
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:16,600
i'll relax

428
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:18,500
sashi... so

429
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,100
you're kidding me?!

430
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:20,900
where's "Su"

431
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,400
it's "Sashisuseso" you know

432
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,800
try to say it from "AEIOU"

433
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:27,300
"AEIOU"..."KAKIKUKEKO"..."SASHI... SO"

434
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:31,800
"SU&SE" are missing.

435
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:35,600
"Shhhh" I can but "ShiShi to" I can't

436
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,000
-Eh?

437
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:36,500
"ShiShi to"

438
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:36,700
shishi to?!

439
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:37,900
Hates the word "ShiShi to"

440
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:41,000
i thought you just said die

441
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,800
What are you going to do about eating Green pepper (shishito)

442
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,800
ehhh.. no.. uhm.. when you put "toka"

443
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:51,330
Shishito pose.

444
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:53,650
Kawago

445
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:54,660
Kawago

446
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:55,660
As i thought Himetan again

447
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,900
-why this also?

448
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:00,260
Himetan's something like...

449
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:04,800
Who's face did she saw down the stage and was like "AHH"

450
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:12,300
So there isn't... uhm a towel with everyone's name on it huh? that's why she saw it and went "AHH"

451
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:16,000
Well me, I think I'll probably try doing it to everyone

452
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:16,500
The best in everyone.

453
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,800
Try haha... so you'll try it to whomever

454
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:20,000
with some staring eye's

455
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:20,900
with staring eye's

456
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,700
I'll come closer and say "I found you" that kind of feeling is amazing

457
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:30,000
but doesn't everyone do that "found you"

458
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:33,000
but it's like your pulling someone

459
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:36,800
-I see i see i see

460
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,200
Let's talk about for a while

461
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,000
I wanna hear about this.....

462
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:39,400
did you do it?

463
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:42,300
because i can't see them all

464
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:43,100
-ah cause their is a big scale of people

465
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,000
because you saw them raising your towel that's why..

466
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,900
Yes, that's why I said "Ahhh" "Thank you" "Haaaa" "Heee"

467
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,900
-Mechanical service

468
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:53,800
-right right right right

469
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:57,800
But there is a tendency that a person's characteristic is mimicked

470
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:58,400
it's true

471
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,600
everyone one has to watch their origanal self

472
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:01,900
right.

473
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,800
everyone has exaggerated characteristics

474
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:07,340
everyone here is a bit exaggerated except for Ikuta because she showed us her true self.

475
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:10,610
Woman beyond mimicry.

476
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:18,050
Up next, the monomane with life impact is found?

477
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:24,000
Next three monomane entries will be done by Wakatsuki alone.

478
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:26,000
Next monomane is this!

479
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:35,400
Matsumura Sayuri's embarrassed at full power when given a compliment

480
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:40,100
thank you very much for your time we'd like to start the interview

481
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:40,700
onegaishimasu~

482
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:49,000
YAAAA~ I'm really happy, actually my oshimen is Matsumura-san

483
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:53,100
EHHH!! I'm glad, what do i do? HEHEHEHE~~~

484
00:20:56,950 --> 00:21:04,290
Alright next monomane please!

485
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:09,200
The mysterious movements inside the dressing room by Matsumura Sayuri.

486
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,300
Suun!

487
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,300
te te te te

488
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Tekori hmmhehehe~~~

489
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:24,400
There's something like that

490
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,900
yiiiyaa I wanna hear this

491
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,700
So let's continue next please!

492
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:42,900
Matsumurua Sayuri eating Eggsandwich with sound because of onomatopeia.

493
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:43,000
-Sayurin again

494
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:51,810
hmmhehehe~~ ham ham ham ham

495
00:21:56,910 --> 00:22:00,010
Onomatopeia queen

496
00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:01,950
Amazing, Wakatsuki you alone

497
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:02,520
3 consecutive.

498
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,410
on Matsumura

499
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:07,210
-Wakatsuki 3 consecutive copied Matsumura

500
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:08,510
you know Matsumura well

501
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,210
you two watch monomane right?

502
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:12,800
ah right

503
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:15,000
She really puts out the sound that much?

504
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,510
she... does

505
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:22,510
During recording... when were about to begin.. "Suun!"

506
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:23,500
-she went "Suun!"

507
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,810
teko teko teko... tekori

508
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:27,240
isn't that bad

509
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,100
Mysterious onomatopeia festival.

510
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:29,520
Eh I don't say such things

511
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,820
but you said it yourself

512
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:33,520
when she eats food properly...

513
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,000

Mystery pose
