12
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:16,530
<font size="40">this time definitely I want to bring everyone in.</font>

00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:17,530
<font size="40">First is this.</font>

14
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:20,560
<font size="40">Gourmet?</font>

22
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,300
<font size="40">Even people who don't like karaage will find this gourmet easy to eat. There are still more.</font>

00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:29,000
<font size="40">- Kujuu?

00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:43,620
<font size="40">So far, I've introduced delicious foods. But, there's not only that.</font>

44
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,460
<font size="40">Speaking of Oita, of course</font>

45
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:51,950
<font size="40">The best hot spring (onsen) in Japan! 
Everyone clapping. It is onsen!</font>

46
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:55,620
<font size="40">Not found in other prefectures, what onsen is that?</font>

47
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:57,480
<font size="40">Ramune onsen!</font>

48
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,390
<font size="40">It contains carbon dioxide. The moment you enter the onsen, the silver granules stick to your whole body.</font>

52
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,960
<font size="40">And then</font>

53
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,750
<font size="40">Myoban onsen is located in Beppu. It has mud.</font>

54
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:16,580
<font size="40">- At the moment you go into the onsen, you can be packed in mud.
- Amazing!</font>

55
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:21,350
<font size="40"><font size="30">{\an1}Myōban onsen ; Beppu mud bath onsen is expected to have skin beauty effect.</font>

56
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:23,830
<font size="40">A place called "Shoya no Yakata" is a cobalt blue onsen.</font>

57

<font size="40"><font size="30">{\an1}Shoya no Yakata; Onsen which looks cobalt blue by chemical reaction of natural ingredients.</font>

58
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:28,750
<font size="40">It does not use any bathing agent (bath salts) at all.</font>

59
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:32,420
<font size="40">Actually, I'd like to show you a photo, not a drawing like this. Such a good-for-nothing drawing.</font>

60
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,940
<font size="40">Certainly</font>

61
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:40,080
<font size="40">For members ashamed in onsen, there are also onsen you can enter while still dressed.</font>

62
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,350
<font size="40">Enter the best host springs in Japan, everyone, let's aim for the best idol in Japan!</font>

63
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:47,350
<font size="40">Having that said. That is Oita. I am finished.</font>

64
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,300
<font size="40">Wonderful!</font>

65
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:54,050
<font size="40">- But this is an onsen tour, right?
- That's right.</font>

66
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:57,400
<font size="40">- Is it okay for Nogizaka to be naked?
- That isn't okay.</font>

67
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,700
<font size="40">Being naked is a little...</font>

68
00:03:58,700 --> 00:03:59,900
<font size="40">- Is it OK if only the upper half?
- No, no, no, no, no.</font>

69
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,350
<font size="40">Is the upper body safe?</font>

70
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:05,000
<font size="40">But if you go into a hot spring, you'll definitely need such pictures.</font>

71
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,900
<font size="40">That would be sexy person in charge.</font>

72
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:10,100
<font size="40">- Then big sister members will take care of it.
- Are they okay?</font>

73
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:14,280
<font size="40">- Are you into swimsuit? Not really. In public.
- Towel. Is towel okay?</font>

74
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:19,550
<font size="40">However, the place to wear a swimsuit is not just an onsen. There's also in a pool.</font>

75
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:21,150
<font size="40">- Many places.
- Pool?</font>

76
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:24,600
<font size="40">Because of the performance of light, the night is great.</font>

77
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:31,750
<font size="40">You can see the Oita city at a glance. It looks like a fantasy of light. All together while everyone is in the onsen.</font>

78
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,070
<font size="40">- Well, the light is good, but it's about what you wear.
- The light is important.</font>

79
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:35,640
<font size="40">Than such thing...</font>

80
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:40,980
<font size="40">The second is, Hokkaido representative, Hashimoto Nanami.</font>

81
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,940
<font size="40">Hokkaido is such a strong candidate.{Incomprehensible}</font>

82
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:43,820
<font size="40">A winning candidate</font>

83
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:44,620
<font size="40">It's because</font>

84
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:47,680
<font size="40">At this point I already want to go to Hokkaido!</font>

85
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,400
<font size="40">No need for presentation.</font>

86
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,320
<font size="40">I thought so!</font>

87
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,750
<font size="40">- The power of gourmet is great.
- Akita-ken exists, so please wait for it.</font>

88
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,020
<font size="40">Well then let's begin. Ready, go.</font>

89
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:05,720
<font size="40">- Everyone, I'll ask you straightforward. Anyone wants to go to Hokkaido?
- Yes!</font>

90
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:09,970
<font size="40">Akita, Osaka, Chiba, raising hands. Oita doesn't wanna lose.</font>

91
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:11,350
<font size="40">- Hokkaido, right?
- Right.</font>

92
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:14,850
<font size="40">Hokkaido is really popular as a tourism destination.</font>

93
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:18,020
<font size="40">Moreover, having vast lands, everything is there.</font>

94
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:23,120
<font size="40">Everyone, what you're going to present or what you've just presented...
Hokkaido has them all!</font>

95
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,750
<font size="40">Absolute champion.</font>

96
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:28,420
<font size="40">- That's not true! Not true!
- Ah, I see. Everything is there.</font>

97
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:33,450
<font size="40">Among them, I've collected what I especially want to recommend this time.</font>

98
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:35,450
<font size="40">Good, this opening is good.</font>

99
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:40,350
<font size="40">- The first one is this. My hometown, Asahikawa.
- Oh, Asahikawa.</font>

100
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:44,650
<font size="40">This is Asahikawa. Thinking about location shooting, this is a really nice place.</font>

101
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:49,170
<font size="40">The access is good. From Asahikawa, we can go to Biei and Furano, famous tourist spots.</font>

102
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:50,850
<font size="40">That's unfair!</font>

103
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:56,970
<font size="40">Among them, what I'd like to recommend is that as soon as you get out of Asahikawa airport, go straight up the hill.</font>

104
00:05:56,970 --> 00:06:00,220
<font size="40">There's a place called Tamura farm.</font>

105
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:03,770
<font size="40">There you can have a soft cream made from fresh milk</font>

106
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:05,520
<font size="40">and go out to the terrace</font>

107
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:05,730
<font size="40">sit down on the shaded terrace and eat while watching the cows.</font>

108
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:11,200
<font size="40"><font size="30">{\an1}Tamura Farm - Use freshly squeezed raw</font></font>

109
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,470
<font size="40">You can taste The Hokkaido.</font>

110
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:17,720
<font size="40">If you go a little north, my recommended spot is a town called 'Bifuka'.</font>

111
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:20,010
<font size="40">What can you find there</font>

112
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:22,010
<font size="40">Genghis Khan (a dish) is very delicious.</font>

113
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:23,800
<font size="40">- Genghis Khan, right?
- So strong!</font>

114
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,400
<font size="40">- That's awesome, they look like they wanna eat now.
- That's right!</font>

115
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:31,750
<font size="40">I think there are a lot of people who don't like Genghis Khan because of its smell.</font>

116
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:35,360
<font size="40">The Genghis Khan here just ate a live sheep a while ago.</font>

117
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,370
<font size="40">It's fresh, but...</font>

118
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:39,150
<font size="40">- That's scary! - Why is that? Why is that?</font>

119
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:44,220
<font size="40">It's such an expression, but of course it doesn't smell like that and it looks delicious.</font>

120
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:47,350
<font size="40">- In Biei, in here, definitely please visit it.
- What is that?</font>

121
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:50,650
<font size="40">- There's a place called Zerubu hill.
- Zerubu?</font>

122
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:51,270
<font size="40">- When it's just around early summer, the sunflower field spreads. - Sunflower field?</font>

123

<font size="40"><font size="30">{\an1}Zerubu Hill Flower field can be watched with a background of Mount Asahidake and Mount Tokachi</font></font>

124
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:57,560
<font size="40">I wanna see it.</font>

125
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,350
<font size="40">Besides that, tulips and various flowers bloom.</font>

126
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:03,550
<font size="40">You can run that vast flower field with a buggy (4-wheeled motorbike) !</font>

127
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:10,020
<font size="40">I really wanna go! I love buggy! Buggy is so much fun!</font>

128
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:13,400
<font size="40">In Otaru, you can do a night cruise through the canal.</font>

129
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,250
<font size="40">- So nice!
- A very beautiful canal called the Otaru Canal</font>

<font size="40">- So strong!
- I wanna go there!</font>

00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:29,520
<font size="40">Everyone, definitely, yoroshiku onegaishimasu!</font>

134
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,750

- Wonderful!</font>

135
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:36,240
<font size="40">- Hokkaido, that is very strong.
- This is the top.</font>

136
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,320
<font size="40">- Shiraishi.
- Yes.</font>

137
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,750
<font size="40">How is this presentation?</font>

138
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,260
<font size="40">I think it's good in Hokkaido!</font>

139
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:42,410
<font size="40">Prompt decision</font>

140
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:44,200
<font size="40">Hokkaido is very good.</font>

141
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:49,200
<font size="40">Though she said that the accessibility is good, it'll definitely take an hour or two traveling by car.</font>

142
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,640
<font size="40">When moving to the next place?</font>

143
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:53,750
<font size="40">- Hokkaido is vast.
- To go to Asahikawa, it takes a lot of time.</font>

144
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,770
<font size="40">Only 2.5 hours to Osaka.</font>

145
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:58,190
<font size="40">- Hokkaido by airplane
- It's 1.5 hours by plane.</font>

146
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:00,580
<font size="40">No, but, but</font>

147
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:02,080
<font size="40">Crushing defeat</font>

148
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,580
<font size="40">Look! This is your time.</font>

149
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:20,900

150
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:26,430
<font size="40">Third hometown presenter, Akita-ken representative, Ikoma Rina.</font>

151
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,430
<font size="40">Here is the first.</font>

152
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:31,310
<font size="40">Kakunodate Bukeyashiki (Samurai Mansion)</font>

153
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,460
<font size="40">In Akita prefecture, there's a place where samurai residences are lined up.</font>

154
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:36,730
<font size="40"><font size="30">{\an1}Kakunodata no Bukeyashiki


Historic samurai residences and rows of cherry blossoms are beautiful "the little Kyoto of Tohoku"</font></font>

155
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:41,890
<font size="40">It is called Little Kyoto, a very beautiful town street.</font>

156
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:45,340
<font size="40">If you visit it in spring, in the cherry blossom blooming season</font>

157
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:50,170
<font size="40">with time slip feeling, you can eat dumplings with samurai residences as your surroundings.</font>

158
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:52,520
<font size="40">It's relaxing.</font>

159
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:57,290
<font size="40">The good thing of Akita, it really makes you forget city life, from the moment you arrive in Akita.</font>

160
00:08:57,290 --> 00:08:59,130
<font size="40">And because people are kind</font>

161
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:04,960
<font size="40">when you go to these places, you can feel like you're back home.</font>

162
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,210
<font size="40">Next, my favorite.</font>

163
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:10,310
<font size="40">I want you to drink Nitte old cider.</font>

164
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:11,900
<font size="40">There are lots of cider variants, aren't they?</font>

165
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:12,650
<font size="40"><font size="30">{\an1}Nitekosaida


It uses water from Rokugo water spring which is chosen as one of 100 famous waters of Japan</font></font>

166
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:14,490
<font size="40">I think this is the most tasty.</font>

167
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:15,230
<font size="40">- Cider?
- Yes.</font>

168
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:21,240
<font size="40">In the town where Nitekosaida comes from, there are very beautiful water springs called "Rokugo Spring Group"</font>

169
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:24,430
<font size="40">- There are a lot of water springs in this place.
- It's made from it.</font>

170
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:28,000
<font size="40">With that clear water, there is not only cider.</font>

171
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,000
<font size="40"><font size="28">Nagashi Somen is a unique way of serving the thin white noodle via flowing cold water, conventionally slide down from sliced bamboo pipe.</font></font>

172
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,930
<font size="40">There's nagashi-sōmen with everyone, too.</font>

173
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:31,380
<font size="40">Appeal of nature</font>

174
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:33,140
<font size="40">That's good. Such thing is good.</font>

175
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:36,520
<font size="40">Even now you can drink that water, directly.</font>

176
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:42,440
<font size="40">Drinking water together, the inside of heart and body will be purified by the water.</font>

177
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,270
<font size="40">There is such a thing.</font>

178
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:49,610
<font size="40">And there's stuff like sweets.</font>

179
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:53,600
<font size="40">There's a shop called Yamano Hachimitsuya.
<font size="28">Famous shop that sold any kind of honey related product</font></font>

180
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,930
<font size="40">- Good. Going on these routes thoroughly is good.
- Right! Right!</font>

181
00:09:57,090 --> 00:10:02,060
<font size="40">There is a popular sweets that's quite hard to obtain even for Akita-ken people.</font>

182
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:04,850
<font size="40">There is cream puff with honey.</font>

183
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:05,660
<font size="40"><font size="30">{\an1}Honey cream puff


Sandwich of freshly baked choux pastry filled with honey cream</font></font>

184
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:11,310
<font size="40">After all, everyone, with various food offered, I think your appetite has increased.</font>

185
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:19,030
<font size="40">However, I definitely want you to taste this moderately tender cream puff, made of natural ingredients, that Yama-san shop has to offer.</font>

186
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:25,350
<font size="40">Here too, not losing to Hokkaido's nor Oita's, there is a delicious softcream.</font>

187
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:29,290
<font size="40">- They also have softcream?
- Yes, there's softcream with honey.</font>

188
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:33,730
<font size="40">Finally, the famous place that I want to go to, Oga.</font>

189
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:37,630
<font size="40">It's Oga. I think everyone has heard about Namahage in Oga.
<font size="25">Namahage in traditional Japanese folklore is a demon-like being, portrayed by men wearing hefty ogre masks and traditional straw capes (mino) during a New Year's ritual.</font></font>

190
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:39,170
<font size="40"><font size="30">{\an1}Oga


Oga's Shinzan Shrine is said to be one of the birthplace of Namahage.</font></font>

191
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:45,160
<font size="40">Here we can eat fresh seafood caught in the sea of Japan. And because of that</font>

192
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:48,560
<font size="40">It's really the best place for refreshing.</font>

193
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:54,790
<font size="40">And the biggest challenge is that, compared to Hokkaido, Akita prefecture is only passed through.</font>

194
00:10:55,720 --> 00:11:01,460
<font size="40">It is not incorporated into the schedule of the tour! Absolutely!</font>

195
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:06,700
<font size="40">- 6 prefectures of Tohoku, Hokkaido, only Akita is passed through!
- Eh? Really?!</font>

196
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:11,700
<font size="40">Aomori, Iwate, Yamagata, Miyagi, only Akita is passed through.</font>

197
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,370
<font size="40">- Why?
- Yeah.</font>

198
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,140
<font size="40">Go Hiromi-san will come! Every year.</font>

199
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:18,470
<font size="40">Spiritual home</font>

200
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:26,120
<font size="40">That's it. If Nogizaka comes to Akita, because perhaps people don't know about any other groups, they are going to love Nogizaka.</font>

201
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:29,950
<font size="40">Let's make supporters here!</font>

202
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:35,660
<font size="40">Because there are such things, certainly I want to go on location shooting in Akita together. Yoroshiku onegaishimasu!</font>

203
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:38,780
<font size="40">Ah, it is good.</font>

204
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:45,650
<font size="40">On the contrary, well of course Hokkaido is good, but as a location for shooting, everyone has already seen it.</font>

205
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:47,010
<font size="40">Everyone has seen it, that's why</font>

206
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:51,910
<font size="40">- If we go to Akita, we can get a feeling that we've never felt before.
- Everyone will appreciate.</font>

207
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:53,300
<font size="40">Continuing on the fourth presenter, Osaka representative, Matsumura Sayuri.</font>

208
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:57,480
<font size="40">{\an7}There was an earthquake of seismic intensity 3 in the Kyushu region at 0:10 in the morning.</font>

209
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:00,230
<font size="40">Firstly, the first one is this.</font>

210
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:01,970
<font size="40">Tennōji Zoo</font>

211
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:06,670
<font size="40">- What?
- That's such an idiot-like tone, ten~no~ji do~but~su~en</font>

212
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:10,730
<font size="40">Tennoji zoo, it is located in a place called Tennoji.</font>

213
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:11,870
<font size="40">Anyway, it is cheap.</font>

214
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:14,280
<font size="40">- Eh?! So cheap!
- That's right!</font>

215
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:17,400
<font size="40">For adults, 500 yen. Children are free to enter.</font>

216
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,200
<font size="40">Free for preschooler</font>

217
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:19,930
<font size="40">That's right!</font>

218
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:23,870
<font size="40">- That sounds like there's no exotic animals there, isn't it?
- No, no, no, no!</font>

219
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:25,680
<font size="40">They have everything, for real!</font>

220
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:30,420
<font size="40">- Native to New Zealand, a bird called Kiwi. They have it.
- That's amazing!</font>

221
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:32,420
<font size="40">Is that the first thing to say?</font>

222
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:34,830
<font size="40">- Perhaps a bigger one.
- Elephant, like an elephant.</font>

223
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:37,410
<font size="40">Next, speaking of Osaka, here!</font>

224
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:43,120
<font size="40">- USJ! (Universal Studio Japan)
- This one is strong.</font>

225
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,170
<font size="40">As for me, I know where cameras are located, all of them!</font>

226
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:50,860
<font size="40">- Camera? What do you mean?
- Inside those attractions, they will take your photos, right?</font>

227
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:56,050
<font size="40">In which scenes, in which moments the shutters are pressed, I know all of them.</font>

228
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:57,110
<font size="40">Amazing.</font>

229
00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:00,740
<font size="40">Right! That's why, in the Spider-man, you use sunglasses, right?</font>

230
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:06,940
<font size="40">So, when our face is difficult to be seen, at that time only, I will say "Take off your sunglasses now!"</font>

231
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:08,740
<font size="40">- It will be perfect!
- Amazing!</font>

232
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:11,360
<font size="40">We can take pictures with Spider-Man!</font>

233
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,360
<font size="40">Amazing! Everyone is happy.</font>

234
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,310
<font size="40">Thank you so much.</font>

235
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:19,830
<font size="40">Alright, next! Kanjōsen Tamatsukuri (Train)
<font size="28">Osaka Loop Line, Tamatsukuri Station</font></font>

236
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:21,580
<font size="40">Why such a tone.</font>

237
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:25,930
<font size="40">Here, through the on-site broadcast, the station attendant always says ....</font>

238
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,850
<font size="40">"Tamachikubi"
<font size="28">Chikubi means nipple.</font></font>

239
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:29,830
<font size="40">What do you mean?</font>

240
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:32,720
<font size="40">- Tama<i>chikubi</i> is said for Tama<i>tsukuri</i>.
- That's right.</font>

241
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,410
<font size="40">"The next is~ Tamachikubi~ Tamachikubi~" It's said that way.</font>

242
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:39,110
<font size="40">Perhaps the station attendant is aware of this.</font>

243
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:40,860
<font size="40">- Really?!
- That is a famous thing.</font>

244
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:44,320
<font size="40">- Then we go there to hear it?
- Go there to hear it.</font>

245
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,150
<font size="40">- Nishino is from Osaka too.
- Yes.</font>

246
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:48,450
<font size="40">Does Osaka have a lot of nice places?</font>

247
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:52,630
<font size="40">Well, it seems to me that there's no other choice but USJ.</font>

248
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:52,630
<font size="40">USJ dependency</font>

249
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:55,430
<font size="40">Eh, why? There's more to it.</font>

250
00:13:56,410 --> 00:14:00,940
<font size="40">Lastly, the fifth presenter, Chiba prefecture representative, Takayama Kazumi!</font>

251
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:08,480
<font size="40">Good points of Boso! Gourmet trip! I want to do it.</font>

252
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,370
<font size="40">First of all, I too will start from here. Soft cream!</font>

253
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:15,570
<font size="40">Soft cream. Everyone pushes forward their soft cream.</font>

254
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:21,920
<font size="40">These are the soft creams that got the 2nd and 3rd place in the TUNNELS-san's (comedy duo) ranking.</font>

255
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:22,950
<font size="40">What ranking is that?</font>

256
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:31,870
<font size="40">In a TV show called "Tonneruzu no Minasan no Okage deshita", there was a location shooting about soft cream in Chiba prefecture.</font>

257
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:33,760
<font size="40">- I've seen it before.
- Thank you so much.</font>

258
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,170
<font size="40">- And Chiba got its 2nd and 3rd position.
- That's TUNNELS-san, what did you thank for?</font>

259
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:38,970
<font size="40">Personnel of the show?</font>

260
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:41,010
<font size="40">{\an1}<font size="30">Biwa soft cream
Biwa (loquat fruit) Club</font></font>

261
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:41,010
<font size="40">{\an1}<font size="30">Peanuts soft cream
Kimura Peanuts</font></font>

262
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:45,650
<font size="40">And among them, in the 2nd place is Biwa Soft Cream, and in the 3rd place is Peanut Soft Cream.</font>

263
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:48,840
<font size="40">- It looks delicious.
- It's really really delicious.</font>

264
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,490
<font size="40">What is in the 1st place?</font>

265
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:52,840
<font size="40">The 1st is the Mother Farm's</font>

266
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,710
<font size="40">- Ah, still in Chiba?
- Yes, soft cream.</font>

267
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:58,230
<font size="40">- The best three are all in Chiba?
- Yes, that's right.</font>

268
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,060
<font size="40">Farm is strong, right? As expected.</font>

269
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:00,910
<font size="40">Defeat to the farm</font>

270
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:04,130
<font size="40">Farm's milk. Farm's milk is strong.</font>

271
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:08,040
<font size="40">Going on, here it is. Ikamenchi.</font>

272
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,220
<font size="40">- I wanna try it.
- Somehow I know about it.</font>

273
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:10,970
<font size="40">Ah, you know?</font>

274
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:10,970
<font size="40"><font size="30">{\an1}"Ikamenchi" at Kamashinnikuten


Popular menu of minced squid tentacles and vegetables shaped into patties and deep-fried</font></font>

275
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:16,080
<font size="40">Since I was young, I grow up eating ikamenchi very often.</font>

276
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:21,280
<font size="40">Recently those who listened well to the TV show gave it a try.</font>

277
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:24,930
<font size="40">There are people who can wait in a long queue to get it.</font>

278
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:28,440
<font size="40">Truly, its tastiness level is worth that much.</font>

279
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:37,350
<font size="40">For a magazine called "Spirits", a long time ago, when I did a photo-shoot as if I was walking in hometown</font>

280
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:40,220
<font size="40">Our manager was also coming there.</font>

281
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:42,960
<font size="40">The manager spontaneously said a single word.</font>

282
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:43,920
<font size="40">Delicious!</font>

283
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:44,620
<font size="40">Staff acclaim!</font>

284
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:47,420
<font size="40">- Looks alike. Looks alike.
- Delicious!</font>

285
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:50,840
<font size="40">He said it was "So delicious!"</font>

286
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:55,080
<font size="40">- He looked delighted.
- Why do you draw the manager saying delicious?</font>

287
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,640
<font size="40">- He was very happy.
- Ah, because members are familiar with him.</font>

288
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:03,020
<font size="40">And then, next is this. Local Chinese cuisine, Houkirou-san.</font>

289
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:04,620
<font size="40">- China?
- Eh, Houkirou.</font>

290
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:08,740
<font size="40">This is a pretty high-class Chinese restaurant.</font>

291
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:15,980
<font size="40">Rather than going there quite often, actually I usually go to that place when I want to celebrate, on special occasion.</font>

292
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:22,860
<font size="40">What happened last time, when I became the Boso tourism ambassador, the restaurant president greeted me.</font>

293
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:27,600
<font size="40">That is where this restaurant president said this to me.</font>

294
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:28,450
<font size="40"><font size="28">At the inauguration ceremony of 
Boso ambassador</font></font>

295
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:28,450
<font size="40"><font size="28">Boss of Restaurant</font></font>

296
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:28,450
<font size="40"><font size="28">Please come to eat here next time.</font></font>

297
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:28,450
<font size="40"><font size="28">In that case we will offer the fine cuisine 
not to be found on the menu</font></font>

298
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:36,790
<font size="40">Please come to eat here next time. In that case we will offer the fine cuisine not to be found on the menu.</font>

299
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:39,660
<font size="40">- Ah, very good!
- It's strong!</font>

300
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:42,060
<font size="40">And then, I received his business card.</font>

301
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:44,380
<font size="40">- So, this is in case you go there.
- In case if I go.</font>

302
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:51,680
<font size="40">Perhaps everyone can eat the high-class food that  you probably don't usually eat in Tokyo otherwise.</font>

303
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,680
<font size="40">- Ah, great!
- I want to go!</font>

304
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:57,120
<font size="40">And speaking of high-class dishes in Boso, here it is.</font>

305
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,620
<font size="40">There's a well-known shop surrounded by rice field.</font>

306
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:03,780
<font size="40">This, its name is deliberately hidden.</font>

307
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:07,260
<font size="40">Perhaps if I say it out, it will be too crowded.</font>

308
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:09,260
<font size="40">Even now it's relatively crowded.</font>

309
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:15,420
<font size="40">If we have a chance to go this place, its name certainly has to be revealed though.</font>

310
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:21,420
<font size="40">This is an upscale French restaurant that uses fish taken in the local area.</font>

311
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:30,900
<font size="40">For a course meal that definitely costs you tens of thousand yen in Tokyo, you can get it at relatively affordable price here. I really recommend it.</font>

312
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:35,960
<font size="40">Well, for other regions, even the nearby ones, as expected, it still takes some transportation cost.</font>

313
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:40,560
<font size="40">Because by one-way bus, really, we can go for 2000 yen ...</font>

314
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:40,720
<font size="40">- Obviously its accessibility is the best.
- That's right!</font>

315
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,130
<font size="40">Best for budget</font>

316
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:49,700
<font size="40">If you save the money to eat delicious foods, you can perhaps eat the best food. High-class one.</font>

317
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:54,840
<font size="40">Finally, I've brought <i>sashiire</i> (gift snacks)! Some sweets.
<font size="28">Sashiire is a Japanese custom of giving, usually foods and drinks.</font></font>

318
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:05,980
<font size="40">Here Takayama uses bold strategy of <i>sashiire</i> using daifuku fresh cream from Takayama Seika confectionery that's in her hometown Minamiboso city.
<font size="28">Daifuku is a Japanese mochi dessert stuffed with a sweet filling.</font></font>

319
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:09,400
<font size="40">- Wow, many variants!
- Right! There are many tastes.</font>

320
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,680
<font size="40">Pretty! Very cute.</font>

321
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:15,580
<font size="40">- Have members eaten this <i>sashiire</i> usually?
- We have. Love it. Delicious.</font>

322
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:19,790
<font size="40">- Which one do you recommend?
- My recommendation, I like the pumpkin one.</font>

323
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:22,230
<font size="40">I shall eat the pumpkin then? / Certainly!</font>

324
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:24,730
<font size="40">Cannibalism! / Not cannibalism!</font>

325
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:30,940
<font size="40">Then, the members sitting behind, other than the presenters. Except the presenting members.</font>

326
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:34,680
<font size="40">Chiba prefecture <i>yoroshiku onegaishimasu</i>!</font>

327
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,680
<font size="40">Chiba prefecture <i>yoroshiku onegai...</i></font>

328
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:37,900
<font size="40">Delicious!</font>

329
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:44,760
<font size="40">Because this is a rare cheese, it feels like Japanese and Western collaboration. Tasty!</font>

330
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:47,580
<font size="40">- Wow, delicious!
- Really? The pumpkin is tasty?</font>

331
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:48,560
<font size="40">It's pumpkin cream.</font>

332
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:51,060
<font size="40">I want to eat pumpkins. Give me pumpkins.</font>

333
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:53,060
<font size="40">Delicious!!!</font>

334
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:57,840
<font size="40">Takayama Seika-san, this is an awesome cream you make!</font>

335
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:01,740
<font size="40">- Eh, so happy! Thank goodness!
- This is awesome!</font>

336
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:04,400
<font size="40">- We've never heard.
- Delicious!</font>

337
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:08,060
<font size="40">- If we knew, we would've brought it too.
- I have never heard of it.</font>

338
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:10,710
<font size="40">And near that Takayama Seika</font>

339
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:13,480
<font size="40">{\an7}<font size="30">In Nogizakatte Doko #95 & #96 (4 & 11 August 2013) Takayama told a story of ghost tunnel, and Nogizaka46 visited it at night.</font></font>

340
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,450
<font size="40">There's ghost tunnel! Nearby</font>

341
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:16,300
<font size="40">Local spiritual spot</font>

342
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:22,600
<font size="40">I think it's good to have the tour on the day, then visit it on the way back home.</font>

343
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:25,880
<font size="40">Chiba-ken, definitely, <i>yoroshiku onegaishimasu</i>!</font>

344
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:33,180
<font size="40">Well, the presentations of those five have done, but if anyone has a question</font>

345
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:36,960
<font size="40">like "Can you do this if you go there?" or "Do you have this?" If you wanna ask</font>

346
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,000
<font size="40">Oh, Akimoto.</font>

347
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,780
<font size="40">After all, when going on the location shooting,  I think that interaction with people is important.</font>

348
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:48,100
<font size="40">"I know that people in that place have such warmth!" I want to know about it.</font>

349
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:51,680
<font size="40">Anyone wants to appeal about it? Like "there's this kind of people"</font>

350
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:57,400
<font size="40">About people. My hometown has the impression of bad teenagers (<i>yankee</i>)</font>

351
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,680
<font size="40">in the lower part of Chiba, like in Kisarazu.</font>

352
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:06,570
<font size="40">But, in our generation now, that yankee thing is over. It's rehabilitation age. Everyone is good people now.</font>

353
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:07,960
<font size="40">former yankee = good person</font>

354
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,540
<font size="40">But I somehow understand.</font>

355
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:11,770
<font size="40">- Everyone is good person.
- All in all.</font>

356
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:15,020
<font size="40">But on location, a motorcycle gang there will be interesting.</font>

357
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:21,100
<font size="40">Ah, I see! Those who did such activities, in my father's generation, still exist.</font>

358
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,740
<font size="40">Such stories are interesting.</font>

359
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:29,520
<font size="40">When he got into the train, suddenly he's dragged. And his head was thrown with a block.</font>

360
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,160
<font size="40">Runaway in Boso!</font>

361
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:33,230
<font size="40">- His head was thrown?
- His head was thrown.</font>

362
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:34,330
<font size="40">It's too intense!</font>

363
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:37,760
<font size="40">Well, that's the kind of story that I've heard.</font>

364
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:40,000
<font size="40">Is there anything else?</font>

365
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,000
<font size="40">Ah, Matsumura?</font>

366
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,860
<font size="40">In Osaka, really, as you know, everyone is warm.</font>

367
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:47,860
<font size="40">They are warm and caring.</font>

368
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:50,980
<font size="40">I frequently became a lost child in Osaka.</font>

369
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:55,280
<font size="40">At that time, I didn't ask directions to anyone, I'd just call out.</font>

370
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:58,500
<font size="40">Elderly woman and man would ask "Are you lost?"</font>

371
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:01,400
<font size="40">And then they showed me the way.</font>

372
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,930
<font size="40">And because the atmosphere is very exciting</font>

373
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:07,340
<font size="40">perhaps it's going to be fantastic if Nogizaka goes there.</font>

374
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:08,880
<font size="40">No problem if anyone gets lost?</font>

375
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,880
<font size="40">No problem at all.</font>

376
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,880
<font size="40">We'll be treated as famous thing.</font>

377
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,880
<font size="40">Treated as famous thing.</font>

378
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,440
<font size="40">- That's more like when you're in Akita or Chiba.
- No, no, no, no.</font>

379
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:21,860
<font size="40">If it's Akita, because people just stay in their home</font>

380
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:25,900
<font size="40">Oi, oi, oi, oi! You just dissed Akita prefecture.</font>

381
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:31,420
<font size="40">So then, last appeal one by one before majority voting.</font>

382
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:35,460
<font size="40">Because there is no handshake event held in Kyushu.</font>

383
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:36,600
<font size="40">- That's right.
- That's right.</font>

384
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:42,060
<font size="40">By all means, not only people in this Kanto region but also let's make Kyushu people become Nogizaka fans. </font>

385
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:44,520
<font size="40">So everyone let's go to my hometown Oita!</font>

386
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:47,070
<font size="40">Then, Hokkaido.</font>

387
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:54,100
<font size="40">In the last year's nationwide tour, when Hokkaido was skipped, Hokkaido fans were pretty upset.</font>

388
00:21:55,260 --> 00:22:00,000
<font size="40">In order to solve it, everyone, would you like to go to Hokkaido?</font>

389
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:03,080
<font size="40">Akita.</font>

390
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:07,780
<font size="40">A town where pureness grew up, Akita prefecture.</font>

391
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:10,880
<font size="40">- Sounds so real.
- Like a real candidacy.</font>

392
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,830
<font size="40">- By all means, would you like to go?
- Like a Prefectural Assembly election.</font>

393
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:17,330
<font size="40">Akita is waiting for Nogizaka46!</font>

394
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:19,480
<font size="40">Next, Osaka.</font>

395
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:22,380
<font size="40">I think there are many good places around the country.</font>

396
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:27,040
<font size="40">Everyone, let's play in Osaka's Universal Studio!</font>

397
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:29,540
<font size="40">Universal is the most enjoyable, you know~</font>

398
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:30,640
<font size="40">- I see.
- So strong.</font>

399
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,680
<font size="40">Finally, Chiba!</font>

400
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:35,380
<font size="40">Let's eat Chiba-ken's delicious foods until the evening.</font>

401
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:35,380

414
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:28,460
<font size="40">Maybe it's because of the last appeal.</font>
