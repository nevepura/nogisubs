1
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:09,450
<font size="36"><i>I will call you back later</i></font>

2
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:15,700
<font size="36"><i>Once the festival schedule is out</i></font>

3
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:18,800
<font size="36">So "Samu" isn't really her nickname?</font>

4
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:20,910
<font size="36">I believe so</font>

5
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:24,750
<font size="36">I've always thought it was weird</font>

6
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:27,010
<font size="36">Samu had the looks after all</font>

7
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:29,190
<font size="36">She's a woman in the first place</font>

8
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:39,500
<font face="@HGGyoshotai" size="78" color="#fefefe"><font size="62">Momo no Koto</font></font>

9
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:44,170
<font size="36">Here</font>

10
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:47,130
<font size="36">Thank you</font>

11
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,910
<font size="36">Everyone please help yourselves as well</font>

12
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,140
<font size="36">Thank you very much</font>

13
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:02,370
<font size="36">But why would she use your nickname?</font>

14
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,270
<font size="36">Did she look up to you or anything of the like?</font>

15
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:07,660
<font size="36">I wonder</font>

16
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,000
<font size="36">I don't think so</font>

17
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:12,630
<font size="36">Then is this another "Samu"?</font>

18
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:14,460
<font size="36">Samu...</font>

19
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:16,710
<font size="36">Samu</font>

20
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:19,390
<font size="36">Samgyupsal?</font>

21
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:25,050
<font size="36">Ah right</font>

22
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:27,590
<font size="36">While I have the chance,</font>

23
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:31,680
<font size="36">could I ask for your signatures?</font>

24
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:34,340
<font size="36">Yes, of course</font>

25
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,160
<font size="36">That's our debut single</font>

26
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:41,200
<font size="36">I'm aware, the one that has the "a" and "r" in "Bears" swapped right?</font>

27
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,120
<font size="36">Yes</font>

28
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:45,650
<font size="36">No one, not even the recording studio noticed</font>

29
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:47,820
<font size="36">No one would want to listen to it after all</font>

30
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:50,200
<font size="36">That's not true</font>

31
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:53,400
<font size="36">I sing the songs often at the karaoke</font>

32
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:58,940
<font size="36">Do you girls not sing your own songs? At karaoke and the like</font>

33
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:01,390
<font size="36">Not at all recently</font>

34
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:02,760
<font size="36">You guys?</font>

35
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:06,630
<font size="36">It's been a year since I sang</font>

36
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,640
<font size="36">You used to sing that one song a lot</font>

37
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:14,450
<font size="36">We used to sing a lot in our free time</font>

38
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,830
<font size="36">I see</font>

39
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,110
<font size="36">That's a pity</font>

40
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:21,820
<font size="36">Here</font>

41
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:23,830
<font size="36">Thank you very much</font>

42
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:24,870
<font size="24">TN: Mercari is an online market</font>

43
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:27,370
<font size="36">I'll quickly put it up for sale in Mercari</font>

44
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:31,140
<font size="36">Just kidding</font>

45
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,080
<font size="36">I'll treasure it</font>

46
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:36,570
<font size="36">Please take it easy
- Yes</font>

47
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:37,700
<font size="36">If you'd all excuse me</font>

48
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,410
<font size="36">Thank you very much</font>

49
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,170
<font size="36">He's not just looks, he's also interesting</font>

50
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:50,670
<font size="36">Having a sibling must be nice, I'm an only child after all</font>

51
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,980
<font size="36">I mean an older brother having an idol sister, he would be proud about that</font>

52
00:02:55,940 --> 00:03:00,150
<font size="36">Momo you did say you were proud of Kirara-chan too right?
- Yeah</font>

53
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:02,200
<font size="36">You never felt bad because of her?</font>

54
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:03,150
<font size="36">Nope</font>

55
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:06,290
<font size="36">It's like my sister's happiness makes me happy as well</font>

56
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:08,540
<font size="36">Sounds like you</font>

57
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,500
<font size="36">I'll just take a call</font>

58
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,540
<font size="36">Sure</font>

59
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:23,550
<font size="36">Not wanting to talk further, I just stood up</font>

60
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:27,150
<font size="36">I don't think all sibling relationships are good</font>

61
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:29,100
<font size="36">Contrary to that,</font>

62
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:32,920
<font size="36">I think being connected by blood makes things more unforgivable.</font>

63
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:39,050
<font size="36">2 years ago</font>

64
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:46,600
<font size="36">Good morning
- Morning</font>

65
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,710
<font size="36">You just woke up?</font>

66
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:51,250
<font size="36">Kirara help out too
- Hassle</font>

67
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:53,490
<font size="36">Just get your own soup okay?</font>

68
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,880
<font size="36">What coat should I wear for the new year's shrine visit?</font>

69
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,340
<font size="36">Don't you have a lot?</font>

70
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:00,130
<font size="36">I'm tired of them all</font>

71
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:01,720
<font size="36">Wanna borrow my Chloé coat?</font>

72
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,180
<font size="36">Is it alright?
- Yeah</font>

73
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:06,380
<font size="36">The Chloé one? Didn't you buy that just the other day?</font>

74
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,350
<font size="36">Yeah I haven't used it much so it still looks new</font>

75
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,720
<font size="36">It would probably look good on you
- Alright!</font>

76
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:15,550
<font size="36">Come on Kirara!</font>

77
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:17,360
<font size="36">My sister Kirara</font>

78
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,580
<font size="36">She's a popular idol, different from me</font>

79
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:24,320
<font size="36">She's only 15 and still small
- It's amazing right?</font>

80
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:27,360
<font size="36">You also appeared in the morning show right?</font>

81
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:30,000
<font size="36">Everyone in the neighborhood saw it!</font>

82
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,160
<font size="36">Grandma is so proud because of Kirara!</font>

83
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:36,450
<font size="36">What kind of person was the host? Same as how he is in tv?</font>

84
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:39,050
<font size="36">The difference is a little big</font>

85
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:40,660
<font size="36">Eh is that so?</font>

86
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,920
<font size="36">And here I thought he was a good person</font>

87
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,470
<font size="36">As an idol, Kirara received more attention</font>

88
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:50,060
<font size="36">Because products of cosmetic brands began to rise,</font>

89
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:52,780
<font size="36">it became something sought after by junior high students.</font>

90
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,150
<font size="36">Momo-chan what have you been doing these days?</font>

91
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:57,760
<font size="36">You used to sing in a group right?</font>

92
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:01,510
<font size="36">It was that, the one with the boys baseball team like name</font>

93
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:04,470
<font size="36">It's Udagawa White Bears, I still sing there</font>

94
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,190
<font size="36">You still do that?</font>

95
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:08,100
<font size="36">More or less</font>

96
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:10,540
<font size="36">I saw you guys the other day</font>

97
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:13,580
<font size="36">You were planted in mud by Kojima in that late night show!</font>

98
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,580
<font size="36">That really made me laugh!</font>

99
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:17,840
<font size="36">It was really hard after that!</font>

100
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,530
<font size="36">Mud even went into my nose</font>

101
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,290
<font size="36">There were crayfish inside the mud</font>

102
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:24,550
<font size="36">Did you not get pinched?</font>

103
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:26,130
<font size="36">I did and it hurt!</font>

104
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:28,680
<font size="36">I didn't know idols had those kind of work too</font>

105
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,910
<font size="36">It's really hard</font>

106
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:34,060
<font size="36">Why don't all of us relatives go to Kirara-chan's concert next time?</font>

107
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:34,060
<font size="24">T/N: In case some don't know, uchiwas are the fans that have their faces</font>

108
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:36,270
<font size="36">That sounds great, with us all holding her uchiwa</font>

109
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:39,460
<font size="36">When grandma stands up, I wonder if she'll stand out from the big crowd?</font>

110
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:42,690
<font size="36">That doesn't matter, I mean we're just watching!</font>

111
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:46,590
<font size="36">I'll quit being an idol after all</font>

112
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:48,390
<font size="36">What's wrong..?</font>

113
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:51,010
<font size="36">Kirara!</font>

114
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:56,910
<font size="36">Did I say something..?</font>

115
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:04,910
<font size="36">It's nothing</font>

116

00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,060
<font size="36">Is something bothering you?</font>

00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:22,450

129
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,950
<font size="36">After becoming big,</font>

130
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:28,520

<font size="36">Don't mind the rumors</font>

<font size="36">Let's eat breakfast</font>

139
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:22,950
<font size="36">I'll be going now</font>

140
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:26,750
<font size="36">Kirara, your manager is waiting you know?</font>

141
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:30,180
<font size="36">There were no fake rumors</font>

142
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,390
<font size="36">I mean, the one who started the negative campaign</font>

143
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:36,680
<font size="36">was me posting from fake accounts after all.</font>

144
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:43,270
<font size="36">What kind of person was the host?</font>

145
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:44,160
<font size="36">Same as how he is in tv?</font>

146

<font size="36">The difference is a little big</font>

<font size="36">Eh, is that so?</font>

148
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:50,650
<font size="36">And here I thought he was a good person</font>

149
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:52,530
<font size="36">Of course there's gonna be a difference</font>

00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:53,950
<font size="36">There's the popularity to maintain</font>

151
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:57,460
<font size="36">But he's not a bad person! He comments when needed, and he isn't perverted.</font>

152
00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:00,070
<font size="36">That's Kirara-chan for you! He even follows up for you</font>

153
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,700
<font size="36">Momo-chan what have you been doing these days?</font>

154
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:13,120
<font size="36">At that time I was harassed by negative comments,</font>

155
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:14,740
<font size="36">and it just suddenly stopped.</font>

156
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:27,900
<font size="36"><i>A performance that is just spoiled by the crowd
#WhiteBears #Momo</i></font>

157
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:31,120
<font size="36"><i>She's the only one that messes up the choreography
#WhiteBearsMomo</i></font>

158
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,760
<font size="36"><i>She just sucks up to the management
#Momo</i></font>

159
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,570
<font size="36"><i>Eyes were definitely fixed
#Momo</i></font>

160
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:39,270
<font size="36"><i>No good qualities! Bad upbringing
#Momo</i></font>

161
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:41,080
<font size="36"><i>She runs weird
Really bad physical abilities too
#Momo #WhiteBearsMomo</i></font>

162
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,500
<font size="36"><i>As I envied my sister's success,</i></font>

163
00:08:43,500 --> 00:09:07,040
<font size="36"><i>I thought of giving her the same suffering I get</i></font>

164
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:07,800
<font size="36">So?</font>

165
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:11,070
<font size="36">I'm worrying if this move will be seen properly</font>

166
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:24,630
<font size="36">Excuse me, here are your drinks</font>

167
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:25,950
<font size="36">Thank you very much</font>

168
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:31,530
<font size="36">You guys really like to sing</font>

169
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:33,820
<font size="36">Thank you for always coming here</font>

170
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:36,360
<font size="36">We're sorry if we stay too long sometimes</font>

171
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,450
<font size="36">We're free after all</font>

172
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:39,140
<font size="36">Not at all</font>

173
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:41,960
<font size="36">I always think it's nice seeing how close you all look</font>

174
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:43,440
<font size="36">Thank you</font>

175
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,370
<font size="36">Back then, we used to go for karaoke often</font>

176
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,700
<font size="36">Without troubling anyone, it was our own little place</font>

177
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:53,110
<font size="36">Thank you for your patronage. If you'll excuse me</font>

178
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:04,570
<font size="36">I wonder if she thinks we're just that group of friends that likes to karaoke</font>

179
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:07,490
<font size="36">I wouldn't be surprised if she did, I mean we've always gone here</font>

180
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,180
<font size="36">It's like our second home</font>

181
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,130
<font size="36">Looks like Komiyama-san won't come</font>

182
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:13,800
<font size="36">I told him to show his face</font>

183
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:16,410
<font size="36">He really doesn't come when you want him to</font>

184
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:20,750
<font size="36">Anyways, let's put on a song</font>

185
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:23,680
<font size="36">I don't really remember much</font>

186
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:25,630
<font size="36">I kinda remember the lyrics though</font>

187
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:26,970
<font size="36">How did it go?</font>

188
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:31,820
<font size="36">Something like "Meeting you, it felt like there will be a new tomorrow"?</font>

189
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:32,230
<font size="36"><i>#Kirara has stinky feet</i></font>

190
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:33,680
<font size="36">Those are pretty common lyrics</font>

191
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:35,200
<font size="36">I can't tell from that</font>

192
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,210
<font size="36">Do you remember anything else?</font>

193
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:40,060
<font size="36"><i>Samu
Go outside</i></font>

194
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:44,660
<font size="36">It's the one where you think it's already the chorus, but it actually comes after that</font>

195
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:47,470
<font size="36">A song with typical lyrics and grand music?</font>

196
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:48,630
<font size="36">Is it that?</font>

197
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,930
<font size="36">You understand? 
- Hand it to me for a bit</font>

198
00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:04,610
<font size="36">What is it?</font>

199
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:07,380
<font size="36">I know of that. It's the stolen picture of my sister's face right?</font>

200
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,820
<font size="36">The culprit that can be seen from the side mirror</font>

201
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,560
<font size="36">is without a doubt, me.</font>

202
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:28,470
<font size="36">When did you find out?</font>

203
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,400
<font size="36">Just awhile ago</font>

204
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:35,460
<font size="36">You must be disgusted</font>

205
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:40,970
<font size="36">You're probably wondering what am I doing</font>

206
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:42,340
<font size="36">to my own sister no less.</font>

207
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,390
<font size="36">I'm really the worst</font>

208
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:50,570
<font size="36">Rather than the worst, more like scum at the very least</font>

209
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:57,570
<font size="36">But having a successful sister like that, even I would probably pretend to be a hater.</font>

210
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,040
<font size="36">I mean someone can be jealous of you too, then it would be just the same.</font>

211
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,280
<font size="36">No one would be jealous of me</font>

212
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:07,760
<font size="36">Have you not seen the things they say about you?</font>

213
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,500
<font size="36">I don't look at those</font>

214
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:13,420
<font size="36">A performance that is just spoiled by the crowd</font>

215
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:16,130
<font size="36">Can't follow the choreography at times</font>

216
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:17,580
<font size="36">Just sucking up to the management</font>

217
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:20,320
<font size="36">Well, there's stuff like that</font>

218
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,690
<font size="36">Really, they should come up with something new</font>

219
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:26,640
<font size="36">Probably got her eyes under surgery</font>

220
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:30,930
<font size="36">As if, if I did that I would do it to fix my nose</font>

221
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:33,590
<font size="36">She's unrefined, looks like a result of bad upbringing</font>

222
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:35,510
<font size="36">How I was raised was fine</font>

223
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:38,230
<font size="36">True, your parents are fine</font>

224
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:40,700
<font size="36">Then there's the weird way you run</font>

225
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:42,690
<font size="36">Also horrible at physical abilities</font>

226
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,320
<font size="36">That sounds about right</font>

227
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:48,320
<font size="36">How do you know all of those?</font>

228
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:53,700
<font size="36">Because the one negatively campaigning you was me.</font>

229
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,400
<font size="36">No way</font>

230
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:03,720
<font size="36">Maybe?</font>

231
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,360
<font size="36">Maybe?</font>

232
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:08,960
<font size="36">What? Are you just playing me?</font>

233
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:17,350
<font size="36">I'm sorry I wasn't able to take your call</font>

234
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:19,850
<font size="36">We'll push through with it</font>

235
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:23,470
<font size="36">Shinagawa Stadium at 5 in the morning</font>

236
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,530
<font size="36">I understand. I will confirm it quickly.</font>

237
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:28,900
<font size="36">Thank you for calling</font>

238
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:34,460
<font size="36">I am currently working as an idol manager</font>

239
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:37,100
<font size="36">It's not as glamorous a job as before,</font>

240
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:40,380
<font size="36">but the feeling of jealousy is gone.</font>

241
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:42,000
<font size="36">It is surprisingly fun to do</font>

242
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:51,460
<font size="36">In the end I don't know if Samu saved me or she was just after me</font>

243
00:13:52,100 --> 00:14:01,500
<font size="36">Which was it I wonder</font>

244
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,840
<font size="36">Keep it a secret from the others okay?</font>

245
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,800
<font size="36">Where did you guys go? It's almost time</font>

246
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:10,440
<font size="36">Samu wanna sing?</font>

247
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:13,300
<font size="36">A song to get us pumped would be good
- Yeah!</font>

248
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:21,860
<font size="36">Samu always gets things out of people</font>

249
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,300
<font size="36">Forcing herself inside the hearts of others</font>

250
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:42,350
<font size="36"><i>Love is over
Kaoru Ito</i></font>

251
00:14:50,260 --> 00:15:05,940
<font size="36">But we never listened to Samu</font>

252
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,160
<font size="36">I wonder why "Samu"</font>

253
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,890
<font size="36">What kind of love did you experience?</font>

254
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,000
<font size="36">This is supposed to hype us?</font>

255
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:31,560
<font size="36">You were here</font>

256
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:32,360
<font size="36">Why?</font>

257
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,490
<font size="36">We were talking about leaving soon</font>

258
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:37,130
<font size="36">It would be bad if we miss the last train
-That's true</font>

259
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,790
<font size="36">Let's tell them before leaving</font>

260
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:45,970
<font size="36">What's up?</font>

261
00:15:46,800 --> 00:16:02,530
<font size="36">We're already here, so why don't we take a look?</font>

262
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:04,480
<font size="36">It feels like her undying spirit will appear</font>

263
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:06,480
<font size="36">I bet it will be an amazing room</font>

264
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:09,130
<font size="36">Pitch dark, with a skeleton and the like?</font>

265
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:10,860
<font size="36">Like Torii Miyuki's home?</font>

266
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,160
<font size="36">Or it's really dirty, like a garbage house?</font>

267
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:14,540
<font size="36">You guys should stop that</font>

268
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,530
<font size="36">Here it is</font>

269
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:23,870
<font size="36">Then, I'll wait downstairs</font>

270
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,340
<font size="36">Thank you very much</font>

271
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:32,720
<font size="36">This was Samu's room?</font>

272
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:35,300
<font size="36">It's typical</font>

273
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,500
<font size="36">It really is</font>

274
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:38,600
<font size="36">This is too normal</font>

275
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:41,390
<font size="36">Or is it strangely just like her for it to be like this?</font>

276
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,100
<font size="36">There's none of our idol stuff</font>

277
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:52,070
<font size="36">Shouldn't there be at least a little trace of it?</font>

278
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:54,340
<font size="36">Like a past she wanted to erase?</font>

279
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:57,160
<font size="36">That's cold</font>

280
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,530
<font size="36">I don't know why she suddenly left</font>

281
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:04,170
<font size="36">Maybe Samu didn't really care what happened to Udagawa White Bears</font>

282
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,670
<font size="36">That kinda gets me mad</font>

283
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:10,840
<font size="36">It means she already got rid of us right?</font>

284
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:14,710
<font size="36">You wouldn't know that, unless you ask the person herself</font>

285
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:19,760
<font size="36">But somehow, doesn't it make it seem like it's not real?</font>

286
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:23,390
<font size="36">That in reality she's alive, hiding somewhere</font>

287
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:25,860
<font size="36">Like a grand prank</font>

288
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:31,980
<font size="36">With a hidden camera, watching us be deceived while laughing</font>

289
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:33,190
<font size="36">Through a monitor?</font>

290
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:36,330
<font size="36">Sooner or later she'd come in holding a sign</font>

291
00:17:53,460 --> 00:18:03,970
<font size="36">For real?</font>

292
00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:06,480
<font size="36">Sorry, could you guys sign this t-shirt as well?</font>

293
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:19,070
<font size="36">Thank you very much</font>

294
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,740
<font size="36">I'll quickly post it in Yahoo! Auctions</font>

295
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,580
<font size="36">I'm kidding, I'll treasure it</font>
