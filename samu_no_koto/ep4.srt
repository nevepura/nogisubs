1
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:44,080
<font size="36">A new message from a supposedly dead Samu...</font>

2
00:00:45,060 --> 00:01:05,930
<font size="36">None of us has opened it yet</font>

3
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:12,120
<font face="@HGGyoshotai" size="90"><font size="70"><font color="#fffbee">Sumi no Koto</font></font></font>

4
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:21,280
<font size="36">I'm sure we'll die if we look at it</font>

5
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:23,150
<font size="36">As if that would happen</font>

6
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:24,930
<font size="36">But isn't it a little scary?</font>

7
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:27,980
<font size="36">I don't believe those kind of stuff</font>

8
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:29,300
<font size="36">Then you take a look</font>

9
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:31,490
<font size="36">Fine by me</font>

10
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,670
<font size="36">I don't believe in ghosts and the occult</font>

11
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:45,670
<font size="36">Unlike before</font>

12
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:50,120
<font size="36">2 years ago</font>

13
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,380
<font size="36">Sorry, I think I got that last part wrong</font>

14
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:55,210
<font size="36">It's fine, I made a mistake too</font>

15
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:57,720
<font size="36">I'm not sure but I think I got it wrong too</font>

16
00:01:58,250 --> 00:01:59,730
<font size="36">You forgot it too, right Samu?</font>

17
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:00,760
<font size="36">Nope, I'm sure I did well</font>

18
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,550
<font size="36">Well what nothing we can do now</font>

19
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,570
<font size="36">Let's just do our best next time
- Yeah</font>

20
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:08,540
<font size="36">Everyone makes mistakes</font>

21
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:10,200
<font size="36">So no one blames anyone for it</font>

22
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,780
<font size="36">Then again, I've always thought about it</font>

23
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:17,250
<font size="36">The fact that we can laugh like this over such things</font>

24
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:19,450
<font size="36">maybe its the reason why we're not selling well.</font>

25
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,920
<font size="36">They're not looking anyway
- Yeah, no one would notice</font>

26
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:43,210
<font size="36">I never had an interest in fortune telling up 'till that point, but...</font>

27
00:02:44,280 --> 00:03:08,270
<font size="36">I had an uneasy feeling at that time so...</font>

28
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:10,870
<font size="36">Your ambitions are quite strong</font>

29
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:16,330
<font size="36">However, there seems to be a "wall" obstructing your job that you need to bust through</font>

30
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:20,210
<font size="36">You feel that your friends are still immature</font>

31
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:22,520
<font size="36">and it kind of gets on your nerves.</font>

32
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:26,050
<font size="36">How do you know this?</font>

33
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:29,250
<font size="36">I can <i>see</i> it</font>

34
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,680
<font size="36">I was surprised</font>

35
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:35,150
<font size="36">It was like she already knows everything about me</font>

36
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:40,920
<font size="36">It looks like you'll have to look for a blue object</font>

37
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:45,380
<font size="36">Looks like it will let your efforts bear fruit</font>

38
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:48,470
<font size="36">A blue object...</font>

39
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:54,980
<font size="36">In today's ticket holders</font>

40
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:57,010
<font size="36">Sumi's spot seemed to have a lot more people</font>

41
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,440
<font size="36">I thought that too</font>

42
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:00,250
<font size="36">Just by chance</font>

43
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:03,140
<font size="36">Looking at the sales recently, don't you think we're doing good?</font>

44
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:04,990
<font size="36">At this rate maybe we can reach Budoukan</font>

45
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,980
<font size="36">Here we come Budoukan!</font>

46
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:09,260
<font size="36">How many thousands of people would fit there?</font>

47
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:10,690
<font size="36">Isn't it tens of thousands?</font>

48
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,300
<font size="36">Then it should be 100,000</font>

49
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:15,630
<font size="36">After following my fortune, my luck has turned around</font>

50
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:18,100
<font size="36">With luck quickly taking effect</font>

51
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:20,090
<font size="36">I get the feeling it really is thanks to her.</font>

52
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:25,370
<font size="36">But after all, our goal is Tokyo Dome right?
- Yeah!</font>

53
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:27,280
<font size="36">If you strive, things can really change</font>

54
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,500
<font size="36">I'm telling you it has to be Budoukan</font>

55
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:38,280
<font size="36">For your fortune telling needs, it's Nanahoshi Seira here</font>

56
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,760
<font size="36">When I try looking at your fortune,</font>

57
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:44,260
<font size="36">I can kind of see something unpleasant.</font>

58
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:47,760
<font size="36">If possible, I'd like for you to come see me again</font>

59
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:02,870
<font size="36">A female evil spirit?</font>

60
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:07,240
<font size="36">I believe this evil spirit is preventing your success</font>

61
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:11,750
<font size="36">What do you think I should do?</font>

62
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,440
<font size="36">Why don't we try an exorcism?</font>

63
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:22,090
<font size="36">Exorcism?</font>

64
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:27,760
<font size="36">Since I got worried,</font>

65
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,680
<font size="36">I asked for the exorcism</font>

66
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:34,240
<font size="36">The exorcism costs 30,000</font>

67
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,520
<font size="36">Hello? It's Hasumi</font>

68
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,640
<font size="36">I've just deposited it</font>

69
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,510
<font size="36">Please listen carefully okay?</font>

70
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:47,880
<font size="36">Okay</font>

71
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:50,660
<font size="36">I know you're getting the exorcism but</font>

72
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:53,400
<font size="36">there seems to be 2 evil spirits.</font>

73
00:05:56,470 --> 00:06:00,670
<font size="36">For this instance, we will need a higher level of exorcism so</font>

74
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:05,370
<font size="36">Unless I don't call another exorcist of my level, I won't be able to deal with it</font>

75
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:08,310
<font size="36">I did ask for it but</font>

76
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:10,250
<font size="36">I don't have anymore money.</font>

77
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,180
<font size="36">If it's money then there are plenty of ways to get it</font>

78
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:16,880
<font size="36">But...</font>

79
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:22,320
<font size="36">This isn't your problem alone</font>

80
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:26,060
<font size="36">Misfortune will befall even your family</font>

81
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:27,820
<font size="36">Is that fine with you?</font>

82
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:32,110
<font size="36">From then on I continued following her advice</font>

83
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:36,660
<font size="36">Following everything she said, I deposited the money</font>

84
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,780
<font size="36">Looks like the exorcism isn't enough to handle it</font>

85
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:47,220
<font size="36">looks like it would be good to get a guardian spirit to protect you.</font>

86
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:49,640
<font size="36">Prepare another 100,000</font>

87
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,250
<font size="36">Okay</font>

88
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:55,480
<font size="36">It seems the guardian spirit's spiritual power is too weak</font>

89
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:59,030
<font size="36">We'll need to power it up even more so</font>

90
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:01,720
<font size="36">quickly deposit another 300,000</font>

91
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:03,200
<font size="36">I understand</font>

92
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:07,730
<font size="36">You really have great luck</font>

93
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:14,330
<font size="36">The guardian spirit is amazed by you, and it would be great if you can give 1 million now to seal the deal</font>

94
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:15,880
<font size="36">Isn't that great?</font>

95
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:17,410
<font size="36">Really?</font>

96
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,180
<font size="36">Thank you very much</font>

97
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:24,570
<font size="36">Yes....Okay, thank you very much</font>

98
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:25,950
<font size="36">Well then</font>

99
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,250
<font size="36">Hello?</font>

100
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:45,230
<font size="36">I just saw the flyer and I'm calling to inquire...</font>

101
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,640
<font size="36">Hasumi-san!</font>

102
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,740
<font size="36">Please come out!</font>

103
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:51,780
<font size="36">You're there right?</font>

104
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:53,450
<font size="36">Get out of here damn it!</font>

105
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,270
<font size="36">You know Hasumi...</font>

106
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:57,740
<font size="36">Not ready yet?</font>

107
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,150
<font size="36">It will be troublesome if you don't pay back!</font>

108
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:02,820
<font size="36">You're there aren't you!</font>

109
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:05,760
<font size="36">Hasumi-san!</font>

110
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,520
<font size="36">You know it would be better to get out here quickly right?</font>

111
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:09,650
<font size="36">Pay up brat!</font>

112
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,290
<font size="36">Get out here!</font>

113
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:16,940
<font size="36">I was driven into a corner</font>

114
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:20,010
<font size="36">I don't know what's my reason for living</font>

115
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,850
<font size="36">If the train were to get derailed</font>

116
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:24,880
<font size="36">and just crush me, it would be better.</font>

117
00:08:28,580 --> 00:09:00,020
<font size="36">That's impossible right?</font>

118
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:00,710
<font size="36">Sumi!</font>

119
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:15,030
<font size="36">What are you doing here?</font>

120
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,200
<font size="36">In order for Samu to not find me out, I tried to regain my composure</font>

121
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:23,630
<font size="36">Out on a walk!</font>

122
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,300
<font size="36">Come with me then if you're free</font>

123
00:09:54,310 --> 00:10:08,490
<font size="36">Keep at it!</font>

124
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:09,650
<font size="36">It has become intense!</font>

125
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:11,880
<font size="36">It's dangerous so please clear off</font>

126
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:37,110
<font size="36">To the me who lives a useless life, watching pro wrestling,</font>

127
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,690
<font size="36">I don't understand why they are trying to win.</font>

128
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:45,260
<font size="36">But watching them with so much energy in front of me</font>

129
00:10:45,260 --> 00:11:19,560
<font size="36">I can feel their drive.</font>

130
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,260
<font size="36">Jump!</font>

131
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:21,930
<font size="36">Jump!</font>

132
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:47,520
<font size="36">How is it?</font>

133
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:49,190
<font size="36">It was amazing</font>

134
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:52,350
<font size="36">It's like I can feel my body fluttering with the excitement</font>

135
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:56,090
<font size="36">I didn't know about it</font>

136
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,890
<font size="36">that you were a pro-wrestling fan</font>

137
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:00,300
<font size="36">It's not that I like it though</font>

138
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:05,190
<font size="36">Let's go home</font>

139
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,620
<font size="36">Ready?</font>

140
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:23,980
<font size="36">I'm opening it</font>

141
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:35,970
<font size="36">Girls! There you are just standing come on let's drink!</font>

142
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:38,560
<font size="36">Stop it come on let's go there!</font>

143
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,720
<font size="36">Sorry about that</font>

144
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,250
<font size="36">Wanna read it in a more quiet place?</font>

145
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:48,340
<font size="36">Where would that be?</font>

146
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:51,040
<font size="36">That would be...</font>

147
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:54,310
<font size="36">Ah thank you</font>

148
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:57,410
<font size="36">It's been a while!</font>

149
00:12:57,590 --> 00:12:58,550
<font size="36">Komiyama-san!</font>

150
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:00,120
<font size="36">It really has been!</font>

151
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:01,850
<font size="36">You really came to visit</font>

152
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:04,290
<font size="36">I have to go back to Tokyo now though</font>

153
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:08,220
<font size="36">Once we're done here, would you give us a ride back as well?</font>

154
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:09,660
<font size="36">That's fine</font>

155
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,340
<font size="36">But to be taken away by a truck</font>

156
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:19,270
<font size="36">without even noticing.</font>

157
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:21,850
<font size="36">The driver said she committed suicide</font>

158
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:23,140
<font size="36">Suicide?</font>

159
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:24,770
<font size="36">After buying stuff?</font>

160
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:25,770
<font size="36">Yes</font>

161
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:27,000
<font size="36">As if</font>

162
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:29,620
<font size="36">Besides, do you know what she bought?</font>

163
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:31,020
<font size="36">Milk chocolate</font>

164
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:32,050
<font size="36">Right</font>

165
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,220
<font size="36">She bought a whole pack you know</font>

166
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:36,180
<font size="36">33 pieces inside</font>

167
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:37,720
<font size="36">33?</font>

168
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:39,990
<font size="36">I was curious so I asked about it</font>

169
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:42,300
<font size="36">There are 3 kinds of chocolate inside</font>

170
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,300
<font size="36">"Ah today's this flavor" she goes</font>

171
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:47,430
<font size="36">She eats that happily everyday as if drawing fortune slips.</font>

172
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:50,410
<font size="36">You think a person like that would commit suicide?</font>

173
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,170
<font size="36">Well that's true...</font>

174
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:54,740
<font size="36">It's not a suicide after all</font>

175
00:13:56,450 --> 00:14:12,850
<font size="36">As if Samu would do something like that</font>

176
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:13,690
<font size="36">Is until here fine?</font>

177
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:16,860
<font size="36">Yes. Thank you very much
- Thank you very much</font>

178
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:20,380
<font size="36">Ah, I heard about it</font>

179
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:22,740
<font size="36">you're set to be in Budoukan right?</font>

180
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:26,370
<font size="36">Congratulations
- Congratulations!</font>

181
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:37,840
<font size="36">Wait a second!</font>

182
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:42,180
<font size="36">Is that how you guys <i>really</i> feel?</font>

183
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:48,420
<font size="36">Don't you guys actually feel upset and jealous, and that it can't be helped?</font>

184
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:50,420
<font size="36">Of course not....</font>

185
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:52,870
<font size="36">I'll tell you how I feel</font>

186
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,310
<font size="36">I really wanted it to be you guys</font>

187
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,850
<font size="36">Not the ones I'm handling now</font>

188
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:02,850
<font size="36">I wanted to get there with you guys</font>

189
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,770
<font size="36">I feel bad so I'll say this</font>

190
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:11,800
<font size="36">"Was it that it really wasn't meant to be you guys?"</font>

191
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,050
<font size="36">But the timing really just wasn't right.</font>

192
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:19,360
<font size="36">Someday for sure in another opportunity,</font>

193
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,350
<font size="36">the perfect timing will come with it.</font>

194
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:25,690
<font size="36">May it be in work, or in love</font>

195
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,070
<font size="36">Don't let the <i>Budoukan</i> then get away.</font>

196
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:34,810
<font size="36">Go up that same <i>stage</i> and <i>sing</i></font>

197
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:37,840
<font size="36">Yes</font>

198
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,580
<font size="36">We'll <i>sing</i></font>

199
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:43,540
<font size="36">It's the first time, that you said something when we needed it.</font>

200
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:47,290
<font size="36">What's with that?</font>

201
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:49,850
<font size="36">It's just Kimu's words of affirmation</font>

202
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:54,550
<font size="36">Will you guys go there now?</font>

203
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:55,760
<font size="36">Yes</font>

204
00:15:56,950 --> 00:15:57,700
<font size="36">It's room 202</font>

205
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:58,690
<font size="36">202?</font>

206
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:04,000
<font size="36">It's feels so nostalgic</font>

207
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,440
<font size="36">It hasn't changed at all</font>

208
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:06,640
<font size="36">I missed this</font>

209
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,750
<font size="36">Everything's still the same</font>

210
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:15,920
<font size="36">This is my spot</font>

211
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:17,910
<font size="36">And this is my spot</font>

212
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:22,850
<font size="36">Feels like home!</font>

213
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:27,990
<font size="36">This was Samu's seat</font>

214
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,600
<font size="36">Yeah</font>

215
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:36,020
<font size="36">Enough of that,</font>

216
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:37,840
<font size="36">let's take a look.</font>

217
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:38,930
<font size="36">Yeah</font>

218
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,370
<font size="36">Here we go</font>

219
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,640
<font size="36">Ready, go</font>

220
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:53,250
<font size="36">What is this?</font>

221
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:55,180
<font size="36">One-click phishing?</font>

222
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:57,790
<font size="36">Those malicious stuff?</font>

223
00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:00,320
<font size="36">Like a phishing scare will stop us</font>

224
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:01,290
<font size="36">One more time</font>

225
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:03,260
<font size="36">Ready, go</font>

226
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:07,530
<font size="36">"Afforestation volunteer"?</font>

227
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,770
<font size="36">Isn't this Samu?</font>

228
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,650
<font size="36">It really is her!</font>

229
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:27,860
<font size="36">Stop global warming she said</font>

230
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:36,140
<font size="36">"Let's save the endangered polar bears from the effects of global warming!" it says</font>

231
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:37,990
<font size="36">White bears...</font>

232
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,000
<font size="36">Udagawa <i>White Bears</i>!</font>

233
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,140
<font size="36">Isn't today the day White Bears was formed?</font>

234
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:49,710
<font size="36">It is! I totally forgot about it!</font>

235
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:54,000
<font size="36">This is probably a scheduled message, I heard apps can do that</font>

236
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,950
<font size="36">Samu remembered</font>

237
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,620
<font size="36">The day we were formed</font>

238
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:01,250
<font size="36">Looks like we weren't just nothing to her</font>

239
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,210
<font size="36">What have you guys been up to recently?</font>

240
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:26,080
<font size="36">As for me right now...</font>

241
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,850
<font size="36">I'm living together with a girl.</font>

242
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:30,350
<font size="36">My girlfriend, for that matter</font>

243
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:36,580
<font size="36">I'm a lesbian, actually</font>

244
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,460
<font size="36">I didn't know</font>

245
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,530
<font size="36">Are you happy?</font>

246
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:44,670
<font size="36">Yeah</font>

247
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:45,900
<font size="36">Really happy</font>

248
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,040
<font size="36">Once we have enough money, someday we're planning on starting a cafe</font>

249
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:52,940
<font size="36">That sounds nice</font>

250
00:18:56,250 --> 00:19:00,150
<font size="36">I am currently undergoing group therapies</font>

251
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:03,880
<font size="36">People who can't stop drinking gather and talk about their experiences</font>

252
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:05,850
<font size="36">But Kimu you don't drink..?</font>

253
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:08,320
<font size="36">Sorry...that was a lie</font>

254
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:12,460
<font size="36">Then you must've been holding back this entire time</font>

255
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:14,130
<font size="36">Good job Kimu</font>

256
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:15,960
<font size="36">Thanks</font>

257
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,450
<font size="36">Right now I'm working as Kirara's manager</font>

258
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:21,450
<font size="36">You two really get along well</font>

259
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:22,930
<font size="36">That's not true</font>

260
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:26,130
<font size="36">I've been keeping from everyone but</font>

261
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:29,410
<font size="36">In all honesty, I've always envied Kirara</font>

262
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:33,680
<font size="36">I've also done what haters do</font>

263
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:38,360
<font size="36">For you to be her manager despite that</font>

264
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,600
<font size="36">that's admirable.</font>

265

269
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,300
<font size="36">Yeah</font>

270
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:53,570
<font size="36">But it's nothing to worry about anymore</font>

271
00:19:54,310 --> 00:20:00,900

<font size="36">It's our debut song</font>

276
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,180
<font size="36">I really like this intro</font>

278
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:19,060
