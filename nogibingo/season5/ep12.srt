<font size="69"><b>Really?</b></font>

46
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:13,170
<font size="69"><b>Like, I can't comment on LIVE

47
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:18,910
<font size="69"><b>Must speak in front of many people</b></font>

<font size="69"><b>The most important is to let your voice out</b></font>

51

00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,130
<font size="69"><b>So for me 
</b></font>

56
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:58,080
<font size="69"><b>There is no great burden for Nogizaka, and certainly builds better responsibilities</b></font>

57

</b></font>

58
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:04,980
<font size="69"><b>You should be able to assume this responsibility

59
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:06,370
<font size="69"><b>So true</b></font>

60
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:10,060
<font size="69"><b>Before expressing their opinions, they tend to hide in the corner 
</b></font>

61
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:15,750
<font size="69"><b>As expected, everyone thought, ah-there must be someone expressing their opinion  so I think it's okay</b></font>

62
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:19,220
<font size="69"><b>Ideas such as these always arise</b></font>

67
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:46,840

68
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:51,620
<font size="69"><b>And share this experience with members</b></font>

69
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:54,930

70
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:01,820

<font size="69"><b>A lot of feelings that arise</b></font>

105
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:41,480
<font size="69"><b>So second gen is more highlighted, it's okay</b></font>

106
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,860
<font size="69"><b>I always say it

107
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:45,640
<font size="69"><b>That's right, what do you think Karin?</b></font>

110

113
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:20,150
<font size="69"><b>There is no such feelings like "Restraining Yourself"</b></font>

114
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:23,220
<font size="69"><b>This becomes a question</b></font>

115
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:27,020
<font size="69"><b>There must still be a tenuous relationship between first generation and second generation</b></font>

116
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:29,880
<font size="69"><b>Ikuta, What's there that you want to say?</b></font>

117
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:39,970

120
00:08:56,930 --> 00:09:02,240
<font size="69"><b>Personally how to get rid of these tenseness is very important</b></font>

121
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,200

122
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,950
<font size="69"><b>So I think we should talk more with second generation</b></font>

130
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:43,350

131
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:46,110
<font size="69"><b>I understand, I understand

133
00:09:54,240 --> 00:10:00,370
